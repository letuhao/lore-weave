"""Prometheus metrics registry for knowledge-service (K6.5).

Single CollectorRegistry shared across the process. All K6 code paths
import the counters/gauges/histograms from here so /metrics exposes
them via prometheus_client.generate_latest().

The registry is module-level (not the prometheus_client default
REGISTRY) so tests can reset it without disturbing other processes,
and so we don't accidentally export built-in process/GC metrics that
would bloat the scrape.
