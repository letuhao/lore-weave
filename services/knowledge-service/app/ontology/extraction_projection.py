"""Project a knowledge-service ``ResolvedSchema`` into the SDK's
``ExtractionSchema`` (KG customizable-ontology, lane LB / L7 activation).

The SDK (``loreweave_extraction``) deliberately does NOT import
``app.db.ontology_models`` — it consumes a plain dict via
:meth:`ExtractionSchema.from_resolved`. This module is the knowledge-service
side of that contract: it reads the resolved (system→user→project merged)
schema and emits exactly the dict shape the SDK expects.

**Two consumers, two postures (the L7 pre-drop reconciliation):**

  * the **write boundary** (``write_pass2_extraction``) wants the *authoritative*
    schema — real ``allow_free_edges`` — so it is the sole closed-set
    enforce-and-triage-park point (Milestone A);
  * the **SDK prompt path** (``extract_pass2`` in worker-ai) wants an *advisory*
    projection — ``allow_free_edges`` forced True — so the vocab is injected as a
    *hint* into the prompt but the SDK never pre-drops an off-vocab predicate
    (which would rob the writer's triage park of the edge). Pass
    ``advisory=True`` for that path (Milestone B).

``event_kinds`` is intentionally empty: event kinds are not part of the
customizable ontology yet (the schema models entity-kinds, edge-types,
fact-types, and closed vocab sets like ``drive`` — never an event-kind vocab).
An empty list makes the SDK inject no event hint + accept any event kind, i.e.
today's static behavior — never stricter.

Spec: docs/specs/2026-06-20-knowledge-graph-customizable-ontology.md §1.1, §10-B1.
