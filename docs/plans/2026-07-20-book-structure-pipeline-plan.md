# Plan / RUN-STATE — Book Structure Pipeline (build)

**Spec:** [`docs/specs/2026-07-20-book-structure-pipeline.md`](../specs/2026-07-20-book-structure-pipeline.md) (v2, adversarially reviewed).
**Goal (committed):** plan + build the spec; **QC + `/review-impl` + a live e2e test per slice** to prove each works.
**Branch:** feat/frontend-tools-mcp-migration. **Started:** 2026-07-20.

## Commitment / invariants (re-read after any compaction)
- Resolver owner = **book-service** (holds chapters + the `structure_node_id` join key + lifecycle; calls
  composition for the *small* parts list + active work, bearer-forwarded — the `parts_import.go` pattern via
  `cfg.CompositionServiceURL`).
- **Parts are always read** (book_id-scoped, Work-independent) → Bug 4 can't recur.
- **LEFT-JOIN-safe:** a chapter whose `structure_node_id` points at an arc / foreign / archived / missing
  node falls to **Unassigned**, never dropped, never filed under an arc.
- **No silent seams:** no silent chapter truncation (book-service owns chapters locally — page fully);
  writes validate targets (P2); FE surfaces mutation errors (P2).
- **Rail = mode-by-content + toggle** (parts-only→parts; outline-only→unchanged; both→toggle; neither→flat).
- Each slice: TDD → VERIFY (paste real output) → `/review-impl` → **live e2e** (real stack) → commit.

## Composition endpoints the resolver uses
- `GET /v1/composition/books/{book_id}/parts` → `{items:[{part_id,title,sort_order,lifecycle_state}]}` (arc.py:574)
- `GET /v1/composition/books/{book_id}/work` → active work (`work_id`, `project_id|null`) (works.py resolve_work)

## Slice board (done ⇒ an EVIDENCE string, not a checkmark)
- **P1.1 [x] book-service `GET /v1/books/{id}/structure` resolver** — `book_structure.go` + `_test.go` + route.
  EVIDENCE: 4/4 unit tests (grouping/sort/counts, LEFT-JOIN-safety, chapter-conservation, sources passthrough)
  + `go vet` clean + full api suite green; e2e-live on repro book 019f8027 → `{parts:[Part 1 count 2],
  unassigned 0, kinds:{parts:true,outline:false}, sources:{parts:ok,work:ok}}`. No book-service
  route-conformance gate exists (glossary-only), so no contract entry needed. NOTE: resolver returns the
  parts skeleton + `active_work.project_id` (kinds.outline = project_id!=null, the P1 outline signal);
  chapters lazy-loaded per group by the FE (P1.2).
- **P1.2 [~] FE `useManuscriptTree` reads `/structure` + mode-by-content + `[Parts|Outline]` toggle.** Files:
  structureApi.ts, manuscriptLens.ts (pure), useBookStructure.ts, useManuscriptTree.ts (source now lens-derived),
  ManuscriptNavigator.tsx (toggle). `source` is content-derived so a Work-book WITH parts → 'chapters' → loads
  parts (Bug 4 gone); outline-only → unchanged; partless → flat. EVIDENCE: 147 manuscript tests green (6 new
  lens + refactored hook + navigator + a HIGH regression test) + `tsc --noEmit` clean. `/review-impl` caught +
  FIXED: (HIGH) a /structure ERROR left the rail permanently 'pending' → now degrades to flat; (MED) creating
  the FIRST part didn't flip the lens until the 5s cache expired → invalidate /structure on create/trash/restore.
  e2e-LIVE (browser, vite :5199 → gateway, repro book 019f8027 = Part 1 + a REAL Work = outline mode): the
  Manuscript navigator renders "PART · Part 1 · 2" with Chapter 1 + Chapter 2 nested, the [Parts|Outline]
  toggle present, footer "1 part · 2 ch". Before P1.2 this book was outline-mode → Part 1 HIDDEN (Bug 4);
  now it shows. **P1 COMPLETE — Bug 4 fixed end-to-end (resolver → FE → live browser).**
- **P2.1a [x] Backend write silent-seam:** `setChapterPart` (HTTP, the FE drag path) validates the target is a
  LIVE part of this book via `validatePartTarget` (reuses P1.1's composition fetch) → typed error instead of
  silently accepting any UUID. EVIDENCE: go vet + e2e-live (bad UUID→422 BOOK_PART_NOT_FOUND, good→200,
  null-unhome→200, archived-part→422). review-impl: no HIGH (VIEW/EDIT-gated, 502 on composition outage).
- **P2.1b [x] FE surfaces part-mutation errors** — a `runAct(promise, msg)` wrapper toasts on failure; applied
  to ALL 8 mutation sites (create/rename/trash/restore/drag-move/reorder-up/down). A failed mutation now shows
  a toast instead of silently reverting on reload. EVIDENCE: 34 navigator vitest + tsc clean + browser
  regression (navigator still renders Part 1 + toggle, 0 console errors; the P2.1a 422 is what runAct now
  surfaces). The failed-drag case is the highest-value (a stale/bad part target → 422 → toast, no silent revert).
- **P2.1c [ ] mobile "Move to part…" affordance** (chapter→part is native-drag only — no touch path). DEFERRED.
- **P3.1 [ ] Lifecycle cascade:** `book.lifecycle_changed` outbox → composition consumer (soft-trash/restore/hard-delete structure); resolver joins book lifecycle; kind-gate to novel.
- **P4.1 [ ] Agent + guidance (rescoped):** `book_get_structure` MCP + metadata-vs-structure tool-selection guidance (or `book_get_overview`). Fixes Bug 2.
- **P5.1 [ ] Cleanup:** consolidate 3 `ensure_work` copies; "part" i18n across 18 locales + fix "Act One" arc seed; route `parts_import` + the arc-grouped Chapter Browser through the pipeline.

## Correctness must-fixes (fold into the touching slice)
- Verify C4 migration UUID-equivalence (test) · `has_work` = two bits (row-exists vs project-backed) · outline/part identity reconciliation.

## Registers
- **Decisions:** owner=book-service; rail=mode-by-content+toggle; drop eager-provision; P4=metadata-vs-structure; kinds_present.outline = the resolved active Work's `work.project_id`!=null (mirrors the FE's resolveActiveWork; a lazy/null-project Work ⇒ outline=false = 'chapters' mode).
- **Parked:** —
- **Debt:** (1) MED — no unit/contract test pins composition's `/parts` response shape the resolver parses (a
  field rename silently degrades parts to empty). `/work` shape now has `decodeStructureWork` regression tests;
  `/parts` still relies on the e2e. (2) LOW — the MCP tool `book_chapter_set_part` (agent path) is NOT yet
  target-validated like the HTTP path: the MCP ctx has `user_id` but no user bearer, and composition's `/parts`
  is bearer/VIEW-gated, so validation needs a new composition internal parts route (X-Internal-Token + X-User-Id).
  Mitigated: the resolver's LEFT-JOIN-safety makes a bad agent target read as Unassigned (visible, not lost).
- **Drift:** P1.1 `/review-impl` + the Work-book e2e caught a REAL parse bug — `fetchStructureWork` read the top-level `book_project_id` (null for a resolved work) instead of the nested `work.project_id`, so kinds.outline was ALWAYS false → the FE toggle would never appear for a planned book. FIXED + regression-tested (`decodeStructureWork`) + re-e2e'd (repro book with a real Work → outline:true, parts still present). This is why e2e-per-slice is in the goal.
