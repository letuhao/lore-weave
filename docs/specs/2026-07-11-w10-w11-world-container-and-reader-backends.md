# W10 World-Container + W11 Reader/Lore-Seeker — Track B backend design

**Status:** DESIGN — awaiting sign-off before BUILD.
**Track:** B (domain backend). Unblocks Track C's W10/W11 surfaces (`TRACK-C.md` "Consumes: B's backing tools for W2/W4/W10/W11").
**Date:** 2026-07-11 · **Branch:** `feat/context-budget-law`
**Supersedes framing:** the board called W10/W11 "P2, structurally large, biggest structural gap." Grounded research (2026-07-11, three parallel探査 agents) shows both are **largely wiring over substrates that already exist** — plus exactly two genuinely-greenfield pieces (W10 maps; W11 public lore access).

---

## 0. What the research changed

| Assumption (board) | Reality (code, anchored) |
|---|---|
| W10 world container is greenfield | **Substrate already built** — `creation-unblock` C20/C21/C22/C28. book-service `worlds` table, hidden bible-book + `sort_order 0` bible chapter, `knowledge_projects.world_id`, `world_rollup.py`, read-only `kg_world_query`, and a full FE `world/` feature. |
| W11 needs a spoiler engine | **Spoiler engine already exists + battle-tested** — `knowledge-service/app/spoiler_window.py:31` `resolve_before_order`, `before_chapter_id`/`as_of_chapter` params across `entities.py`/`timeline.py`/`graph_views.py`, glossary `before_chapter_index` (`canon_at_chapter_handler.go:36`), two-axis `composition-service/app/packer/spoiler.py`. Reveal-chapter signal exists (`MIN(chapter_entity_links.chapter_index)`, KG `event_order`). Reading position is **stored** (`book-service reading_progress`, `migrate.go:179`). |

**Net remaining scope:** W10 = a world-scoped MCP **write** surface + graph authoring + a **new map primitive**. W11 = a reading-position→cutoff **resolver** + a **reader-scoped ask-the-lore facade** (cutoff server-enforced) + a **RAG cutoff** + **KG-auth unification onto grants** + a **new public/anonymous lore route**.

## 1. Locked decisions this design honors / overrides

- **G1 additivity (HONORED).** `OPEN_QUESTIONS_LOCKED.md:16-27` — lore stays `book_id`/`chapter_id`-keyed and *rolls up* to a world via its books; **no `world_id` on existing glossary/knowledge/composition rows.** World-native authoring resolves `world_id → bible_book_id → bible_chapter_id` and writes book-keyed, exactly as the FE does today (`frontend/src/features/world/api.ts:87-116`).
- **"Reader/public product" non-goal (DELIBERATELY OVERRIDDEN — user decision 2026-07-11).** `OPEN_QUESTIONS_LOCKED.md:176-178` listed "reader/lore-seeker product beyond read-only graph/wiki" and "world-level sharing" as non-goals of the earlier cycle. The user has explicitly greenlit the **public/anonymous reader** for W11. This design therefore *retires* that non-goal for W11; recorded here so it stops re-surfacing.
- **New map primitive vs. G1 (SURFACED tension — see §3.3).** G1 forbade retrofitting `world_id` onto *existing* lore to avoid a migration. A world map is world-spanning by nature; a *new* `world_id`-scoped map table is additive (no migration of existing rows) and does not violate G1's letter. This design scopes maps **world-first** and explains the boundary.

---

## 2. Invariants every deliverable must satisfy

- **MCP-first** — all agent-facing capabilities (world create, lore/graph authoring, map authoring, ask-the-lore) are **MCP tools** through ai-gateway, not bespoke HTTP+prompt endpoints. Non-agentic reads (a FE fetching a map) can be plain REST.
- **Provider-gateway** — any LLM/embedding/rerank in the reader "ask" path resolves through `provider-registry-service` (the RAG `raw_search` already does; the answer-composition step, if any, must too).
- **Tenancy / anti-oracle** — every new read/write declares a scope tier + grant check; cross-tenant without a grant returns a **uniform 404/empty** (no existence leak). Spoiler cutoff is **fail-closed** everywhere (unknown position ⇒ nothing passes), mirroring `spoiler_window.py:28`.
- **Tiering** — every new MCP tool declares `_meta.tier` (R/A/W) + `scope`; a `tools/list` gate rejects an untiered tool (Track A precedent, `D-KNOWLEDGE-META-ADOPTION`).

## 3. W10 — World-container backend

### 3.1 World-scoped MCP write surface

**Problem.** World CRUD is HTTP/JWT-only today (`book-service/internal/api/worlds.go`); no MCP tool creates a world or authors world lore world-natively. Glossary propose/confirm are `ScopeBook` — an agent must be hand-fed `bible_book_id`. The FE hides this (`world/api.ts`); the agent surface must too.

**Design.** book-service already exposes an MCP read surface (`mcp_tools_read.go`), so add world tools there:

| Tool | Tier | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `world_create(name, description?)` | **A** (creation) | Runs the existing `createWorld` transaction (`worlds.go:54`): world + hidden bible book (`is_bible`) + `provisionBibleChapter`. Returns `{world_id, bible_book_id, bible_chapter_id}`. |
| `world_list()` / `world_get(world_id)` | **R** | Wrap `listWorlds`/`getWorldByID`; returns `book_count`, `bible_book_id`, `bible_chapter_id`. |
| `world_move_book(world_id, book_id)` | **A** | Wrap `moveBookIntoWorld` (guards `is_bible=false`). |

**World-native lore authoring (hide the bible-book mechanic).** Rather than force agents to juggle `bible_book_id`, the design adds a **world-resolution helper** consumed by glossary/knowledge authoring tools: an optional `world_id` arg that resolves to the world's `bible_book_id` (glossary) / world KG project (knowledge) via a book-service internal route, then authors book-keyed per G1. Storage is unchanged; only the tool ergonomics improve.
- New internal route (book-service): `GET /internal/worlds/{world_id}/bible` → `{bible_book_id, bible_chapter_id}` (owner/grant-checked). Analogous to the existing `/internal/worlds/{id}/books` (`server.go:198`).

### 3.2 Graph authoring tools

Most of this shipped in WS-4B (`kg_project_entities_to_nodes`, `kg_propose_edge`, read `kg_world_query`). Two gaps for world graph authoring:
1. **Manual single-node create** — the known W4 blocker ("no manual node tool; `kg_propose_edge` parks edges whose endpoints aren't nodes yet"). Add `kg_create_node(project_id|world_id, name, kind, ...)` (**Tier-A**). *Build-time verify this doesn't already exist* (anti-laziness rule — the earlier "blocked on missing route" items were often already present).
2. **World-native resolution** — graph tools accept `world_id` and resolve to the world KG project (the bible-book project stamped with `world_id`, `knowledge_projects.world_id`, `migrate.py:978`), so an agent authors "the world's graph" without knowing the project id.

### 3.3 Maps — the greenfield spatial primitive (user chose IN scope)

**Not** the LLM_MMO_RPG procedural tile kernel (`crates/world-gen`, `tilemap-service`, `world-service` — a separate game-runtime stack, downstream-only). This is a **worldbuilder's reference map** (World-Anvil/Inkarnate-lite): a base image with placed pins/regions linked to `location` glossary entities.

**Home service: glossary-service (Go).** Rationale: markers FK to glossary `location` entities (kept intra-service, no cross-service FK); glossary is the authored-lore SSOT and already hosts an analogous authored surface (the `wiki_*` tables). Alternative considered — book-service (owns worlds) — rejected because the marker→entity FK would then cross services.

**Scope: world-first.** A world map spans a world's books, so it carries `world_id` (a *new* additive table, not a G1-violating retrofit — see §1). Markers bridge world↔book: a marker references a glossary entity that is itself book-keyed (in one of the world's books).

**Data model (new, glossary-service):**
```
world_maps(id, owner_user_id, world_id, name, image_object_key, image_w, image_h,
           created_at, updated_at)                        -- image blob in MinIO
map_markers(id, map_id, entity_id NULLABLE, label, x REAL, y REAL,   -- x,y ∈ [0,1] relative
            marker_type, created_at)                      -- entity_id → glossary_entities (location)
map_regions(id, map_id, name, polygon JSONB, entity_id NULLABLE, created_at)  -- optional polygon overlay
```
Scope key `world_id` + `owner_user_id`; every query filters by both; grant-gated for collaborators.

**MCP tools (glossary-service):**

| Tool | Tier | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `world_map_create(world_id, name, image_ref?)` | **A** | Create a map; image uploaded separately (presigned MinIO PUT) or referenced. |
| `world_map_add_marker(map_id, label, x, y, entity_id?, marker_type?)` | **A** | Place a pin; optionally bind to a `location` entity. |
| `world_map_add_region(map_id, name, polygon, entity_id?)` | **A** | Add a polygon overlay. |
| `world_map_get(map_id)` / `world_map_list(world_id)` | **R** | Read markers + regions + image URL. |

**REST (for the FE canvas — Track C):** `POST/GET /v1/glossary/worlds/{world_id}/maps`, `.../maps/{map_id}/markers`, image presign route. FE map canvas is Track C.

**Effort flag:** this is the bulk of W10's new work — new tables + migration, MinIO image handling, 4 MCP tools + REST, and (Track C) a canvas. Its own build milestone.

## 4. W11 — Reader / lore-seeker backend

### 4.1 Reading-position → cutoff resolver

`reading_progress` stores per-chapter rows (`book-service migrate.go:179`), not a single "furthest-read" pointer, but `getReadingHistory` already joins `chapters.sort_order` (`analytics.go:248`).

**Design (book-service):** `GET /internal/books/{book_id}/reading-position?user_id=` → `{furthest_chapter_id, furthest_sort_order}` = `MAX(sort_order)` over the user's rows. Small derivation, no schema change. The reader facade (§4.2) calls it to obtain `before_chapter_id`, then `resolve_before_order` (`spoiler_window.py:31`) turns it into the `before_order` ceiling.

### 4.2 Reader-scoped ask-the-lore facade (cutoff SERVER-enforced)

**Core security property.** In reader mode the spoiler cutoff must be **injected server-side from the reader's own position — never a tool argument the LLM controls.** An agent must not be able to widen its window by omitting/altering `before_chapter_id`.

**Design (knowledge-service — owns "reader backends", `TRACK-B.md:10`):** a **reader context** that wraps the lore reads so `before_chapter_id` is forced to the reader's furthest position (fail-closed if unresolved). Exposed as MCP tools for the reader's chat agent (MCP-first):

| Tool | Tier | Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `lore_ask(book_id, question)` | **R** | The composite "ask the lore": resolves reader position → cutoff → spoiler-windowed glossary known-entities + KG facts/timeline + RAG `raw_search`, returns a spoiler-safe evidence bundle for the agent to answer from. |
| `lore_browse_entities(book_id)` / `lore_entity(book_id, entity_id)` | **R** | Windowed entity list / detail (wrap glossary `before_chapter_index`, KG `before_chapter_id`). |
| `lore_timeline(book_id)` | **R** | Windowed events (wrap `timeline.py before_order`). |

All are **Tier-R**, scope `book`, cutoff auto-injected. The reader's chat agent runs with only these + no write tools.

### 4.3 RAG cutoff on `raw_search` / `story_search`

The one "ask" surface missing a window (`raw_search.py:100-171` has ownership/language logic but no `before_chapter_id`). Passages carry `chapter_index` (`drawers.py:81`, `raw_search.py:253`), so:
**Design:** add optional `before_chapter_id` to `raw_search` (+ `story_search`); post-filter hits by `chapter_index ≤ cutoff`, **fail-closed** on unknown `chapter_index` (drop + count, mirroring `packer/spoiler.py`). The reader facade always passes it; author callers keep today's behavior when omitted.

### 4.4 KG read-auth unification onto grants

Today KG `entities.py` facts/statuses/timeline are **owner-`user_id`-scoped** (`entities.py:562,655`) — a VIEW-granted reader can hit glossary + `raw_search` (grant-gated) but **not** KG facts. Inconsistent.
**Design:** move these onto `resolve_grant(book_id, caller) >= VIEW` (the `grant_client` shim to `loreweave_grants`, already used by `raw_search.py:113`). Security-sensitive (widens readership): keep **anti-oracle** — no grant ⇒ 404/empty, no existence leak; and preserve the "resolve-to-owner" search identity `raw_search` uses. Needs its own red-first tenancy tests.

### 4.5 Public / anonymous spoiler-windowed lore route (user chose IN scope)

**Access boundary.** Only books with `sharing_policies.visibility='public'` (`sharing-service migrate.go:14`). Non-public ⇒ 404 (anti-oracle). Analogous to the existing unlisted-token chapter reads (`sharing-service server.go:108-110`) but for lore, not text.

**Anonymous cutoff = self-declared.** An anonymous reader has no `reading_progress` (no account), so their spoiler cutoff is **client-declared** ("I've read up to chapter N") — a weaker guarantee than the server-enforced grant-holder path (§4.2), acceptable for public exploration. Logged-in grant-holders always get the server-enforced position.

**Data-exposure guard (critical).** The public route exposes **confirmed canon only** — never `ai-suggested`/draft glossary entries, never owner-private KG scratch. Filter to published/confirmed status; spoiler-window on top. Its own review-impl pass at build (public data surface).

**Design (sharing-service or a knowledge public route behind the public-visibility gate):** `GET /v1/public/books/{book_id}/lore?before_chapter=N&query=...` → windowed, canon-only glossary + KG + RAG. No JWT; rate-limited at the gateway edge.

---

## 5. Contracts & discoverability touched

- **New MCP tools** auto-appear in `tool_list` after registration (N1 mechanism, live). Each declares `_meta.tier`+`scope`.
- **C1 category enum** — the new tools are `book`/`glossary`/`knowledge` domain; no new category needed (unlike Track D's `research`). Verify at build that `world_*`/`lore_*`/`world_map_*` prefixes map to an existing `GROUP_DIRECTORY` home, else add the mapping lockstep (the Track-D `web→research` precedent).
- **Track C consumes:** world write tools + `kg_create_node` + map tools (W10 surface); `lore_ask`/`lore_*` + the public route (W11 reader surface). Coordinate signatures with Track C before freezing.

---

## 6. Proposed build milestones (order decided at sign-off)

**W11 (smaller — mostly wiring):**
- **W11-M1** — reading-position resolver (§4.1) + RAG cutoff (§4.3) + KG-auth→grants unification (§4.4). *Pure wiring over existing engines; red-first tenancy + spoiler tests.*
- **W11-M2** — reader ask-the-lore facade + MCP tools, cutoff server-enforced (§4.2). Grant-holders.
- **W11-M3** — public/anonymous canon-only windowed lore route (§4.5). *Public data surface ⇒ mandatory `/review-impl`.*

**W10 (write surface small; maps large):**
- **W10-M1** — world MCP write surface + world→bible/project resolution + `kg_create_node` (§3.1–3.2).
- **W10-M2** — maps primitive: tables + migration + MinIO image + 4 MCP tools + REST (§3.3). *The greenfield bulk; own milestone.*

**Cross-cutting DoD:** each milestone unit + a live cross-service smoke (≥2 services), MCP tools proven effectful (not just tools/list), spoiler fail-closed proven, anti-oracle proven.

---

## 7. Open questions for sign-off

1. **Map fidelity (§3.3).** Confirm "image + pins/regions linked to `location` entities" is the right first cut (vs. coordinate-free region graph, or deferring regions to a follow-on and shipping image+pins only).
2. **Public reader answer-composition (§4.2/4.5).** Should `lore_ask` return an **evidence bundle** for the caller's agent to compose (keeps LLM spend on the caller's BYOK), or compose the answer server-side? Evidence-bundle is the provider-gateway-clean, cheaper default — confirm.
3. **Anonymous rate/abuse (§4.5).** Public lore is an unauthenticated data surface. Confirm gateway rate-limit + canon-only filter are sufficient, or whether public lore should require at least an unlisted token (like today's public chapter reads) rather than being fully open.
4. **Milestone order.** Recommend **W11-M1→M2→M3 first** (smallest, whole new persona end-to-end), then **W10-M1→M2**. Confirm or reorder.
