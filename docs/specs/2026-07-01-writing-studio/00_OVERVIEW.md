# Writing Studio (v2) — Master Spec

> **Status:** ACTIVE · branch `feat/writing-studio` · started 2026-07-01
> **Type:** FE, from-scratch. Does **not** touch the current `ChapterEditorPage`.

## What this is

A new, VS Code–style **docking workspace for a whole book** — the successor surface to the
chaotic 24-tab co-writer studio. dockview owns the centre (drag / split / stack / float /
pop-out); a fixed frame of chrome (activity bar, side-bar navigators, top/status bars, a
toggle bottom panel) wraps it. Panels (the real writing tools) are added **one at a time**.

Frame reference mockup: [`design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-writing-studio-frame.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-writing-studio-frame.html).

## How we work here — build-while-plan (LOCKED)

This track deliberately **inverts** the usual plan-then-build. We build incrementally and
spec **just-in-time**:

- This **master file** holds the durable decisions, the frame architecture, and the
  **component index** (below) with per-component status.
- Each component gets its **own small spec file** (`NN_<component>.md`) written when we start
  it — scope, data, states, done-criteria — not a big upfront plan.
- A component is only as specced as it is built. Specs grow with the code, never ahead of it.

## Locked decisions

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | **dockview-react v7** owns the centre dock | Our in-house dock layer is a single linear rail — can't do splits/tab-groups/regions. dockview = VS Code-grade, zero-dep, MIT, React-18. |
| D2 | New route `/books/:bookId/studio`, book-level (no chapter needed) | It's a whole-book workspace; a book-level "Studio" CTA opens it. |
| D3 | From scratch — reuse shared components + the state-hoist blueprint, **not** the current editor | Easier to control a clean build than retrofit the editor. |
| D4 | **Live/in-flight state lives ABOVE dockview**; panels are thin views over hoisted state | dockview unmounts a closed panel; hoisting keeps co-writer streams / editor docs alive so closing/moving a panel never drops work. Wire when the first *stateful* panel lands. |
| D5 | Fixed chrome (top bar, activity bar, side bar, status bar) is **never** a dock tab; bottom panel is a toggle | Navigation is the spine — it must never be floated, buried, or accidentally closed. |
| D6 | Layout + chrome UI state persist **per-book** in localStorage (per-device) | `lw_studio_layout_<bookId>` (dockview `toJSON`) + `lw_studio_chrome_<bookId>` (active view / collapses). |
| D7 | **Two palettes**, VS Code–faithful — **⌘P / Ctrl+P** = Quick Open (manuscript locations); **⌘⇧P / Ctrl+Shift+P** = Command Palette (open tool panel + chrome actions) | Sidebar tree = spatial map; Quick Open = global jump from any focus; Command Palette = 25+ dock tools the activity bar cannot hold. Overlap with the sidebar jump box is intentional (same data layer — see [`06a_quick_open.md`](06a_quick_open.md)). |
| D8 | **Studio Tool Registry** — every dock panel/tool **registers** on mount | Incremental tool use: palette ([#06b](06b_command_palette.md)) and chat rack ([#07a](07a_agent_context_rack.md)) only show registered entries; unregistered legacy panels are invisible until ported. |
| D9 | **Studio MCP Host** — FE `StudioContextBus` + `studio_context` on chat turns | VS Code extension-host analogue: panels publish context slices; chat + `ui_*` tools consume. Does **not** replace ai-gateway federation. See [`07c_studio_tool_registry.md`](07c_studio_tool_registry.md). |
| D10 | **Agent Context Rack** above chat input; **Runtime Inspector** below chat header | Rack = user-pinned skills/MCP tools (agent capability). Inspector = lazy-load state machine visibility. Separate from [`ContextBar`](../../../frontend/src/features/chat/context/ContextBar.tsx) (turn attachments). |
| D11 | **Agent surface state machine** exposed in Runtime Inspector | Phases: Idle → Curated → Discovering → Activated → SkillInjected → ToolRunning. Mirrors mcp-public-gateway session activation + chat-service discovery. |
| D12 | **Pinned tools** on session (`enabled_tools` / `enabled_skills`) override discovery subset; empty ⇒ auto-discovery fallback | Aligns with [`04-ai-chat-core`](../../2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/stories/04-ai-chat-core.md) tool curation; Rack is the FE for that persistence. |
| D13 | **Manuscript unit hoist** — Rich (#04a) + Raw (#04b) share `useManuscriptUnit` above dockview | One chapter draft + scene metadata; no divergent copies when dock tabs move/close (D4). |
| D14 | **Raw buffer** = `ManuscriptUnitDocument` JSON (`loreweave.manuscript-unit.v1`) | Chapter Tiptap `body` + composition `scenes[]` metadata in one code-like editor — not plain prose. |
| D15 | **Raw Editor** = editable dock tab with code editor UX (format, validate, ⌘S) | Distinct from legacy read-only [`SourceView`](../../../frontend/src/components/editor/SourceView.tsx) toggle inside Tiptap. |
| D16 | **Navigator / Quick Open** can open Rich, Raw, or Reader per chapter | Registry `editor` + `raw` panels; see [`04b_raw_editor.md`](04b_raw_editor.md). |
| D17 | **Scene prose stays in `chapter.body`**; raw `scenes[]` is outline metadata only | Synopsis, status, `beat_role` — not a second prose store. |
| D18 | **5-tier state model** — local → chrome/layout → host → domain hoists → remote SSOT | No god-store as tool count grows; see [`08_studio_state_architecture.md`](08_studio_state_architecture.md). |
| D19 | **Bus = read-only snapshots**; domain mutation through hoist owner actions only | Panels publish context; never mutate another panel's hoist via bus subscription. |
| D20 | **FSM only for orchestration domains** — session boot, save conflict, agent surface | Navigator tree and chrome toggles do not need XState. |
| D21 | **Selector-based subscriptions**; volatile (SSE/streaming) split from stable host context | Prevents whole-frame re-render on every Tiptap keystroke or chat chunk. |
| D22 | **Panel author checklist** mandatory before merging a new dock tool | Register, hoist owner, bus slice, selectors, lifecycle — [`08`](08_studio_state_architecture.md) §Checklist. |
| D23 | **Three-lane agent→GUI model** — ui intent / MCP reconcile / human-gate | See [`09_agent_gui_reconciliation.md`](09_agent_gui_reconciliation.md). |
| D24 | **No data-bearing frontend tools** — agent must not patch GUI via draft/prose blobs in `ui_*` args | Saves tokens; SSOT via reload. |
| D25 | **`StudioEffectReconciler`** — sole path MCP tool success → GUI data refresh | Handlers in code, not LLM `setState`. |
| D26 | **Human-gate Apply** → domain hoist actions; studio deprecates `editorBridge` write path | `propose_edit` / `confirm_action` per #09. |
| D27 | **Agent lifecycle hooks** — server-side event bus + sandbox scripts (`.loreweave/hooks.json`) | Extends agent loop like VS Code/Kiro; not local shell — see [`10`](10_agent_lifecycle_hooks.md). |
| D28 | **Hook bundles** scoped per-user and per-book (MinIO + Postgres); System-tier admin-only | Tenancy per CLAUDE.md; book collaborators EDIT can write book hooks. |
| D29 | **Hook merge** — System → user → book; all match run; **most restrictive wins** (`deny` > `ask` > `allow`) | Aligns VS Code / Copilot multi-source hooks. |
| D30 | **Sandbox-only execution** — `agent-hook-runner` ephemeral container; hooks never bypass #09 reconciler or Tier-W/S | GUI refresh stays code-owned (H1–H5 in #10). |

## Frame regions

```
┌ Top bar (fixed) ───────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Act │ Side bar (fixed) │ Dock area (dockview) ▸ split/float/pop │
│ bar │  active navigator │──────────────────────────────────────│
│     │                   │ Bottom panel (toggle)                 │
├ Status bar (fixed) ────────────────────────────────────────────┤
```

The Side-Bar navigator **drives the dock**: selecting a unit opens/focuses its panel in a
dock group (Explorer → editor-group analogue).

## Testing discipline (LOCKED — this track is stricter than the rest)

**Build-to-solid, no defer.** Every component ships with tests before we move on:

1. **Unit tests** for each component + hook (states, branches, persistence, guards).
2. **E2E** for each component's user-visible behaviour, via a Playwright spec + page object.
3. **Inter-component links:** build the **data link first** (the wiring in code + unit tests).
   **Defer only the E2E of that link** until the *other* component exists — then add it. Record
   the deferred E2E-link on the **Debt stack** below.
4. Each milestone ends with **`/review-impl`** (adversarial) → fix → re-run all tests.

**Debt is a STACK, not a queue — newest debt is paid FIRST (LIFO).** Every deferral is
recorded here the moment it's created; when we start the next component we clear the top of
the stack before adding new rows.

## Debt stack (LIFO — top = paid next)

| ▲ | From | Debt | Clears when |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 01 skeleton | **navigator→dock "open in group" link** — data wiring + its E2E deferred | #02 Manuscript navigator + #03 a dock panel exist → build the link + E2E it |
| 2 | 01 skeleton | Top-bar **Generate / Save / model** controls not built | the first panel that needs them (#03 Compose) |
| 3 | 06a design | **Quick Open build** deferred — needs #02 jump layer + #03 dock panel + Debt #1 navigator→dock wiring | implement #06a after #02+#03; shared `useManuscriptJump` (see 06a §Jump contract) |
| 4 | 06b design | **Command Palette build** deferred — needs ≥3–5 registered dock tool panels | implement #06b after enough dock panels exist; chrome-only commands can ship earlier as a thin slice |
| 5 | 07 design | **Agent chat upgrade build** deferred — needs #03 Compose shell + studio registry (#07c) | implement #07 after #03 + #07c; rack/inspector BE shipped globally (story 04 ✅) |
| 6 | 04b design | **Raw editor build** deferred — needs #04a hoist (`useManuscriptUnit`) + #02 navigator→dock | **absorbed by #12 cycle 1**: the raw editor ships as the `loreweave.manuscript-unit.v1` provider of the generic json-editor panel (see [`12_json_document_standard.md`](12_json_document_standard.md)) |

**Chrome copy (design intent, not yet wired):** top-bar palette affordance → *"Go to chapter, scene, arc…"* (locations only — tools live in ⌘⇧P). Status bar → show both `⌘P` and `⌘⇧P` hints. Mockups: [`screen-command-palette.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-command-palette.html) · [`screen-studio-agent-chat.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-studio-agent-chat.html) · [`screen-studio-raw-editor.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-studio-raw-editor.html) · [`screen-studio-state-host.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-studio-state-host.html) · [`screen-studio-agent-gui-bridge.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-studio-agent-gui-bridge.html) · [`screen-studio-agent-hooks.html`](../../../design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-studio-agent-hooks.html).

**Recently cleared:** ~~Studio inherited `EditorLayout`'s app rail → two left rails~~ → **fixed
2026-07-01**: studio moved to a standalone full-screen `RequireAuth` route (out of `EditorLayout`);
`StudioFrame` root is `h-screen`. The Activity Bar is now the only left rail.

*(Pop the top when starting the next component; push any new deferral on top. Nothing leaves
this table silently — it's cleared by building, not by forgetting.)*

## Out of scope (for now)

Mobile (the studio is desktop-first; small screens fall back to the existing editor); server
sync of layout (localStorage per-device is enough until multi-device studio is needed);
migrating the old co-writer studio (it stays until the new one reaches parity).
