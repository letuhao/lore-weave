# ▶▶ NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE — **Compose synthesis: planning pipeline (0–6) done + self-heal cheap-stack judge upgrade shipped → next is drive the new stack over CH2–12** · branch `feat/editor-compose-overhaul` · 2026-07-01

> **▶ MERGE 2026-06-30: `origin/main` (Temporal-Knowledge / KAL) merged in (55 commits).** The
> knowledge-gateway (**KAL**) unifies glossary/KG reads under INV-KAL: composition's cast-roster read
> moved from `glossary.list_entities` → **`kal.roster()`** (drains the cursor — fixes the ~100-cast
> truncation). Conflict was ONLY `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`; router `plan.py` + `glossary_client.py`
> auto-merged (our `thread_state`/`exit_state`/`seed_entities` survived alongside KAL). Our `seed_entities`
> WRITE (glossary `extract-entities`) passes **both** INV-KAL gates (knowledge-access + http-surface).
> **Verified:** composition unit suite **1209 passed**; `kal.roster()` returns the 10 seeded cast;
> **e2e** on the rebuilt KAL stack — seed → KAL roster → decompose → **34/34 scenes grounded** with
> `present_entity_ids`. Our code is fully on the new standard (roster via KAL; `cast_plan`/`self_heal`
> don't touch glossary directly).


> **What this track is:** the editor/compose UX overhaul **pivoted (PO)** to fixing **output QUALITY first** — POC chapters read as concatenated scenes. Two design docs:
> - **[`docs/specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/`](../specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/)** — the GUI track (validate-first, milestones M0–M5 are a backlog menu, NOT a build order).
> - **[`docs/specs/2026-06-30-chapter-synthesis-self-healing.md`](../specs/2026-06-30-chapter-synthesis-self-healing.md)** — the synthesis track: **Phase 0** (planning connectivity, DO FIRST) → **Phase 2** (multi-pass self-heal). Ordering is locked: garbage-in (disconnected plan) can't be polished out.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (validated, committed):**
> - **Phase 0 slice 1 (intra-chapter connectivity)** — enriched the decompose prompt (goal·conflict·outcome + causality + ending-guided). Fixed the 3 worst reviewer defects (causeless pursuit, grimoire-from-nowhere, disconnected scenes) at the synopsis level, prompt-only.
> - **Phase 0 slice 2 (cross-chapter threading)** — `engine/plan.py`: typed `ChapterExitState` (Character/World/Plot + `advances`) emitted as a same-call delta, threaded chapter→chapter (`thread_state` flag, **default OFF ⇒ today's concurrent fan-out byte-identical**; sequential when ON: prev-chapter exit = fine-grained backbone + cumulative advances = global anti-repeat). Wired through worker + router (additive optional). **Live worker smoke** (Gemma, `thread_state=True`, 12ch/36sc): chapters now open *"Tiếp nối từ…"* the prior exit-state, **arc repetition gone**. `/review-impl`: **0 HIGH**, 4 findings fixed (inline/worker response parity for `exit_state`; both-flags no-op warning; degrade-path test; advances-cap documented). **Tests:** composition unit suite **1180** + slice tests (test_plan 19, router 16, worker_jobs 18 — fixed 5 pre-existing `cancel_check` fake drift) green.
>
> **▶ Self-heal POC — the whole approach was de-risked this session (see the synthesis spec for the data):**
> - **stitch baseline** — the existing 1-pass `stitch` smooths transitions but is NOT a dedup/repair pass, and it **inflates length +68%** (a prompt cleanup did NOT fix it: Gemma rewrites-and-expands by nature; the token cap isn't a clean lever). ⇒ whole-chapter rewrite is the wrong primitive.
> - **L1 dropped** — the "scene-titles mid-chapter" complaint was a POC HARNESS artifact (`to_tiptap_doc` heading-per-scene), not a pipeline defect.
> - **Satellite editing is the answer (PO insight)** — surgical edit of a SMALL isolated span. Mechanism (2) structural isolation works on a small model: `selection-edit` on a 446-char span → ×1.01 length, motif 2→0, meaning preserved (vs whole-chapter ×1.68). Mechanism (1) trust-the-model fails on small models (the stitch result).
> - **The detector must be an LLM JUDGE, not code** (PO) — POC: Gemma returned **7 real findings** (2 logic holes incl. the fall-physics one, emotion-loop, motif, flat villain), each with a `fix` guide, **7/7 locatable (3 exact + 4 fuzzy)** ⇒ the locate step uses **fuzzy/shingle match, not exact**.
> - ⇒ **Full pipeline proven end-to-end:** `LLM JUDGE → fuzzy-locate (code) → satellite-edit (selection-edit) → splice → re-judge loop`. (POC scripts: `poc/judge_poc.py`, harness phases `satellite`/`stitch`.)
>
> **▶ Orchestrator BUILT + live-validated** — `engine/self_heal.py` (`run_self_heal`): judge→fuzzy-`locate_span`→satellite-edit→splice→re-judge; advisory skips (not-located/overlap/runaway-expansion). 12 unit tests. Live on ch1: 6 findings, **6/6 located, 4 edits, length ×1.014** (vs stitch ×1.68), surgical on-target edits. Fixed a false-zero re-judge bug (degraded re-judge now reports None). NOT yet wired to an endpoint (in-container script POC).
>
> **▶ PIVOT (PO) — re-architect PLANNING before drafting.** Reviewing the committed 12-ch plan surfaced many holes at once (no motif binding, empty cast / scene-presence, anonymous new characters, ch1 telescoped). Root cause = `decompose` is **one-shot** (same anti-pattern as whole-chapter stitch). Fix = a multi-step planning pipeline (decompose-and-refine, ONE arc). Spec: [`docs/specs/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline-architecture.md`](../specs/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline-architecture.md) · Build plan + **capability audit** (planning uses ~2/30 engines — the judge constellation promise_audit/succession_entailment/arc_conformance is idle): [`docs/plans/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline.md`](../plans/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline.md). Stages: 0 cast/world · 1 motif-select · 2 arc+tension · 3 char-arc/intro · 4 grounded decompose · 5 plan self-heal · 6 orchestration+checkpoints. Reuse-heavy (motif retriever, templates, arc_apply, self_heal pattern, the idle judges).
>
> **▶ PLANNING PIPELINE COMPLETE (Stages 0–6, all live-validated)** — replaced the one-shot decompose with a multi-step planner, each stage committed + unit-tested + live-POC'd on the Lâm Uyển premise:
> - **0 cast** (`cast_plan.py` propose_cast + `glossary_client.seed_entities`) — 10 cast (6 named + 4 new), seeded → roster → present_entity_ids.
> - **1 motifs** (`motif_plan.py` select_arc_motifs) — 4 arc motifs with roles (spine/recurring/foil/climax).
> - **2 tension** (`arc_plan.py` shape_tension_curve, deterministic) — fixes ch1=100; 100 only at climax.
> - **3 char-arcs** (`character_plan.py` plan_character_arcs) — arcs + introduction schedule (new chars @ fitting beats).
> - **4 grounded decompose** (`grounded_plan.py` + grounding block in `plan.py`) — feeds cast/motifs/tension/intros into the threaded L2.
> - **5 plan self-heal** (`plan_heal.py`) — plan-judge → satellite-edit a scene synopsis by (chapter,scene).
> - **6 orchestration** (`planning_pipeline.py` run_planning_pipeline) — chains 0→1→L1(once)→3→4→5.
> - **Capstone live POC** (`poc/io/full_pipeline.txt`): cast=10 · motifs=4 · arcs=10 · 12ch/30sc/30-with-present · **plan-heal 7/7 findings edited** (4× cross-chapter repetition, a character-before-introduction, a tension-vs-beat, a dangling setup — all real, all fixed).
>
> **▶ Production hardening DONE + the drive STARTED:**
> - **Task A (wired)** — `DecomposeRequest.pipeline=true` → the `/outline/decompose` endpoint runs `run_planning_pipeline` via the worker (`plan_pipeline` op + dispatch + allowlist). **Live e2e:** endpoint→202→worker→cast=9/motifs=4/12ch·35sc/plan-heal 8-8→committed to the outline.
> - **Task B (D-PLAN-CAST-ATTRS, resolved)** — `cast_attributes` maps role/traits/archetype/relationships/summary → the character kind's attr codes; `seed_entities` sends `attributes`+`attribute_actions`. Live-verified: glossary EAV persists role/personality/relationships/description. Drafting grounding now has DEPTH.
> - **Task C (the drive, in progress)** — the full grounded+healed 12-ch plan was generated + committed through the production endpoint; CH1 drafted (grounded) + chapter self-healed (`engine/self_heal.py`) as the prose sample. **NEXT:** draft + self-heal the remaining chapters (drive identically) for the full-story PO evaluation; optional: wire `self_heal` to its own endpoint (currently a script).
> - review-impl on the pipeline: 0 HIGH, 2 MED fixed (motif unrecognised-role drop; L1-once on degrade).
>
> **▶ Cheap quality stack — judge upgrade (SHIPPED 2026-07-01, `engine/self_heal.py`):** the bare judge
> was blind (0 findings on CH1 while real xưng-hô/canon errors stood; confabulated when prompted broad).
> Root cause = no canon grounding, not model size. POC'd 5 layers on the $0 local Gemma (data:
> `poc/io/poc_stack_out.json`), then implemented the validated subset — all **default-OFF ⇒ legacy
> byte-identical**: `canon` (grounds judge **and** satellite editor in a story bible + 2 false-positive
> guards), `vote_k`/`min_votes` (grounded judge ×K, must-quote folded in), `verify` (skeptical
> refute-or-confirm, fail-open), `prefilter` (dup-word + full-recall pronoun findings), `_snap_to_sentence`
> (edit whole sentences ⇒ no splice artifact). **Lesson:** voting alone does NOT kill *systematic*
> confab — only grounding suppresses it + verify refutes the leak. **CH1 re-healed:** 7 defects → near-zero,
> **x0.997**, incl. the canon contradiction (`từng dốc lòng che chở`→`luôn khinh miệt`) fixed by the grounded
> editor; remaining = 1 cosmetic + 1 borderline repetition left for the human/stronger gate. **Tests:**
> self_heal **21** (12 legacy + 9 new) green; full composition unit suite green. Result file:
> `poc/io/ch01_healed_cheapstack.txt`. Spec §"Cheap quality stack".
>   - **Full-book drive (CH1–12, book-level canon of all 9 cast) — `story-export-v2/` + `poc/io/heal_v2_summary.json`:**
>     **modern pronouns `ông/bà/ông ta/bà ta` = 0 real residuals book-wide** (deterministic prefilter is the
>     reliable workhorse); **no inflation anywhere** (x0.998–1.005). Two honest findings: (1) **verify is
>     stochastic + fail-toward-refute → occasionally drops a real finding** (CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` regressed
>     vs the dedicated run; refuted=5/5 on CH03) — a precision/recall knob to tune (lower aggression, or vote
>     the verify), the human gate still matters most for the *semantic* findings. (2) **bug FIXED this commit:**
>     the dup-word collapser would flatten VALID Vietnamese reduplication (`chằm chằm`, `rắc rắc`) — now gated
>     OFF for `_REDUP_LANGS` (vi/zh/ja/ko/th/id/ms); only NFD-diacritic luck spared the v2 corpus, so the
>     exported v2 prose is unaffected.
>   - **(A) verify-recall + (B) canon-from-pipeline — SHIPPED 2026-07-01:**
>     **(A)** `run_self_heal(verify_k=…)` VOTES the verify (`_verify_vote`, majority-refute, tie→keep) so a
>     stochastic single refute can't drop a real finding. **(B)** new `engine/heal_canon.py`
>     (`render_canon` / `convention_for` / `canon_from_proposed`) builds the heal bible from the SAME
>     designed cast drafting grounds on; `PipelineResult.canon` now carries it (rendered in
>     `run_planning_pipeline`). **Live-validated on CH1** ($0 local, canon auto-rendered 2701 chars,
>     `verify_k=3`): the CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` false-refute is **GONE** (residual=False; refuted 4→1), and
>     the rendered canon enabled a new canon catch (Hắc Sát Lão Nhân's role). Tests: self_heal 24 +
>     heal_canon 5.
>   - **M6 Polish — BE done (M6.1 engine + M6.2 wiring), 2026-07-01:**
>     **M6.1** (`c4db3792`) — `_compute_edits` shared step ⇒ `propose_self_heal` returns `EditProposal[]`
>     (id/tier deterministic|semantic/start/end/before/after) WITHOUT splicing; `apply_self_heal_edits(accepted_ids)`
>     splices the accepted subset; `run_self_heal` = propose+apply-all (byte-identical).
>     **M6.2** — worker op `self_heal_propose` (+ SUPPORTED_OPERATIONS + dispatch) + REST endpoint
>     `POST /v1/composition/projects/{id}/self-heal/propose` (resolve draft Tiptap→text + canon [override
>     or roster+convention] → propose → proposals; worker/inline like `plan_pipeline`). **Apply reuses the
>     existing `composition_write_prose`** — no new write tool / no confirm-token surgery. **Live-smoke:**
>     resolve path proven on the stack (get_draft `body` key + draft_version=2 → 7473-char prose; KAL roster
>     12 cast → 823-char canon); propose engine separately live-validated. Tests: self_heal 27 + worker_jobs
>     (dispatch + serialize).
>   - **M6.3 FE — DONE (Polish panel), 2026-07-01:** `PolishPanel` + `usePolishProposals` hook + `api.proposeSelfHeal`
>     / `applySelfHealEdits` (JS mirror of the engine splice); registered `polish` in the **Quality** group
>     (`workspace/types.ts` + `CompositionPanel` SubTab/stripIds/DockSlot, no-remount preserved); accept/reject
>     diff list (deterministic pre-checked, semantic unchecked); Apply → `ChapterEditorPage.handleApplyPolish`
>     replaces the doc via `setContent` (mirrors `handleTranslate`). Endpoint path fixed `/projects`→`/works`.
>     i18n `polish` label ×4 locales. Tests: tsc clean + **722 composition vitest** (incl. 6 new).
>     **NEXT:** re-drive CH1–12 with `verify_k=3` to refresh `story-export-v2/`.
>   - **Deferred D-POLISH-FE-BROWSER-SMOKE** (gate #4, needs FE image rebuild) — full click-through (open
>     chapter → Polish tab → Run → proposals → Apply) on a rebuilt FE image (running infra-frontend is the
>     old baked build). BE resolve-path + propose engine already live-smoked; FE↔BE call is typed + unit-tested.
>   - **/review-impl on M6 (2026-07-01):** **HIGH fixed** — stale cross-chapter proposals would Apply onto the
>     wrong chapter; fixed by `key={chapterId}` on PolishPanel (remount resets the snapshot). **MED fixed** —
>     FE `applySelfHealEdits` UTF-16-sliced Python code-point offsets; added a fail-safe (skip when
>     `slice≠before`). Tests: PolishPanel 7 + tsc clean. **Two MED deferred for a PO decision (snapshot
>     tradeoffs of whole-doc replace):** **D-POLISH-OCC** — Apply uses the propose-time `source_text` +
>     ignores `draft_version`, so edits made after Run (incl. unsaved buffer) are lost → compare version &
>     warn, or apply spans to the live doc. **D-POLISH-MARKS** — Apply rebuilds plain paragraphs ⇒ strips
>     inline marks (AI-provenance/bold) chapter-wide (same shape as handleTranslate). Plus LOW: no router
>     test for the propose endpoint.
>   - **Deferred D-SELFHEAL-CANON-ATTRS** (gate #2, structural) — heal canon is currently convention +
>     roster NAMES (KAL roster is names-only); rich per-character canon (descriptions → catches canon
>     contradictions like Tô Yến "che chở") needs a glossary "full cast WITH attributes" read. The
>     convention already grounds the dominant xưng-hô class; attribute-canon is the enrichment follow-up.
>
> **▶ Deferred (this track):**
> - **D-THREAD-MOTIF-COMBINED** — `thread_state` + `motifs_enabled` together: typed-state threading is skipped on the motif path (motif `prev_effects` carry used; warned, not silent). Gate #2 (needs interleaving the motif sequential select with the threaded invent loop). Target: when motifs + threading are both wanted in one run.
> - **Book-service universal formatter** (slice 01: `tiptap.go`/`server.go` markdown→Tiptap) — built, **uncommitted**, awaiting the PO's read-mode test before a separate commit.
> - GUI milestones M0–M5 — paused behind the synthesis track (output quality first).

> - **F1d (producer)** `d5662b64` — facts FLOW from extraction: translation worker passes `chapter_ordinal`,
>   glossary writeback ingests the episode + opens append-only facts per written attr, idempotent. (`TestBulkExtract_EmitsTemporalFacts`)
> - **F4-live core** `c13d11bb` — glossary `/internal/facts/*`: GET facts/timeline/attr-values (bounded, as-of) + POST
>   episode/append/retract; KAL paths aligned. (`TestFactsHTTP`: append supersedes, retract restitches over the router)
> - **F4-writes** `41070247` — internal merge/resolve-entity/split routes + KAL wiring (resolve-or-create idempotent).
> - **in-story dates** `a5d0d80e` (merged) — `event_date_iso` additive valid-time on KG facts/relations (19 tests; chapter-ordinal stays primary).
> - **prod bugfix** `94caea91` — world-timeline `NameError: q` (pre-existing crash) fixed.
>
> **▶ Remaining foundation (then fanout):**
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** dirty queue + canonical_snapshot write + lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground
>   (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff. LLM via provider-registry (likely a worker/knowledge pass like #26/#7 summarize).
>   Makes `get_canonical` return the FOLDED canonical (today it serves canon-content). Adds the KAL `fold` route.
> - **F1g — bi-temporal names:** name as `fact_kind='name'` (single) + aliases as `'alias'` (multi); as-of-name; resolver
>   matches the across-time alias set. RECONCILE: migration 0048 converts the cold-start/F1d `attribute` name/aliases
>   facts → name/alias kind, and `refreshEAVProjection` + the D5 check must project name-kind facts to the name EAV.
> - then **fanout X1–X7** (parallel worktree agents per the locked strategy).


> **What this branch is:** implementing the Incremental Temporal Knowledge Architecture
> ([spec](../specs/2026-06-29-incremental-temporal-knowledge-architecture.md) §12/§12.7.8 govern;
> [plan](../plans/2026-06-30-temporal-knowledge-architecture-impl.md)). Append-only bi-temporal facts as the
> sole SSOT (INV-FACTS §12.0); everything else a rebuildable cache. Execution = **serial foundation → parallel
> fanout** (user-directed: build foundation serially, checkpoint, then fan out consumer migrations).
>
> **▶ Shipped this session — the SSOT substrate spine, all real-DB verified on `loreweave_glossary`:**
> - **F0** `fc4c9a80` — froze the **KAL v1 contract** (`contracts/api/knowledge-gateway/kal.v1.yaml`), the keystone
>   every consumer binds to; `knowledge-gateway: missing` row in `language-rule.yaml` (→ typescript at F4 scaffold).
> - **F1a** `ae6f17fd` — `0044` **entity_facts + episodes** bi-temporal SSOT schema (content-addressed natural key,
>   `valid_to_eff` INT64_MAX null-sink, `coverage_xid` xid8, merge_journal fact/episode-move cols). Idempotent 2×.
> - **F1b** `728efaf9` — `0045` **maintain_chain** the single `valid_to` writer (§12.3.3). Verified all 3 scenarios:
>   out-of-order backfill (A2), retract restitch (A3), oscillation (A4).
> - **F1c** `8a2b8e6d` — **fact core** Go (`facts.go`): appendFact (idempotent NK), retractFacts (restitch),
>   ingestEpisode, refreshEAVProjection (repair/cutover), per-(entity,attr) chain lock. `TestFactCore` PASSES (real DB).
> - **F1h** `8eb419f9` — `0046` **cold-start seed**: 22,056 facts seeded from live EAV; **projection==flat_eav 0 mismatches** (§12.5.4/D5).
> - **F2 schema** `fdf6c0d8` — `0047` **canonical versioned-cache** tables (canonical_snapshot + canonical_fold_state), §12.1.
>
> ⚠ Migrations **0044–0047 are applied to the running dev `loreweave_glossary`** (by F1c's `RunChain`); a fresh stack
> picks them up from the ledger on boot.
>
> **▶ PARALLEL track (background agent, worktree):** **F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify** in `knowledge-service`
> (Python/Neo4j) — substrate-independent from glossary. Ordinal valid-time unified with `from_order`, ordinal-aware
> close (A2 on the KG side), extraction-driven invalidate/retract, quote-on-citation, per-entity ordinal snapshot.
> **Merge its worktree branch at the integration node before F4.**
>
> **▶ F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify — MERGED `f2d5ca3e`** (was a parallel worktree agent); 24 F3 unit tests
> re-verified green post-merge. All under `services/knowledge-service/` (disjoint from glossary).
>
> **▶ F1f — fact-chain merge + split (DONE):** `ecc7e587` **merge** (§12.4.1, `mergeFactChains`/`revertFactChains`,
> journal `repointed_fact_ids`+`invalidated_fact_ids`, same-ordinal tiebreak, chain locks both sides) +
> `f52e50f7` **split** (§12.4.2, `splitFactsByEpisode` re-attribute-by-provenance, originals reason='split').
> `TestMergeFactChains`/`TestSplitFactsByEpisode` green; existing Merge/Revert/Dedup suites green (no regression).
>
> **▶ F4 — KAL gateway service + INV-KAL lint (DONE, structure):**
> - `2ab5f710` **KAL NestJS service** (`services/knowledge-gateway`) implementing `kal.v1.yaml`: config/main/health +
>   `KalReadController` (get_canonical/get_facts/timeline/list_attr_values/roster/search/neighborhood/retrieve, each with
>   per-substrate `temporal_capability`, KG `as_of` dropped when `temporal_unsupported`) + `KalWriteController`
>   (append/close/retract/merge/split/fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity forwarding to glossary `/internal/facts/*`).
>   **Verified: npm install + nest build clean; boots + serves /health + /health/ready (kgTemporal=ordinal_valid_time),
>   16 routes mapped.** `language-rule.yaml` `missing`→`typescript`; lint PASS.
> - `434894d8` **INV-KAL table-read lint** (`scripts/knowledge-access-gate.py`, wired into `.githooks/pre-commit`): no
>   consumer reads the glossary EAV / Neo4j directly. Full-scan PASS.
>
> **▶ NEXT — F4-FOLLOW-ON + remaining foundation, then fanout:**
> 1. **F4-follow-on (live writes):** add the glossary **`/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** (Go handlers wrapping the F1c/F1f
>    fact core — appendFact/retract/mergeFactChains/splitFactsByEpisode/fold) so the KAL write verbs hit a real target;
>    then a **cross-service live-smoke** (KAL → glossary fact route → DB) + verify the read endpoints' downstream path
>    mapping against the actual glossary/KG routes. (KAL reads/writes build + the service boots; full delegation is the
>    cross-service smoke, currently unverified end-to-end.)
> 2. **F2 app** — the fold handler: lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff
>    (needs a provider-registry LLM call). Enhances `get_canonical` behind the frozen contract.
> 3. **F1g** — bi-temporal name/aliases (§12.4.3) + as-of-name. **Value partly gated on F1d** (deferred writeback wiring);
>    reconciles `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`.
> 4. **CHECKPOINT** → then parallel **fanout** X1–X7 (consumer migrations onto the KAL, FE temporal surfaces).
>
> **▶ SCOPE (locked 2026-06-30): this branch is the PRODUCTION-READY refactor — NO deferrals.** Everything below is
> in-branch work to COMPLETE (the repo adopts the KAL immediately after merge, so nothing core may be stubbed/parked).
> Includes the full consumer + FE fanout (X1–X7) and both INV-KAL lints flipped to ENFORCING. The items that were
> "deferred" are now must-complete work:
> - **F1d — writeback Path-A emission (must complete):** wire fact emission into the glossary writeback; extend the
>   bulk-extract request with `chapter_ordinal` and update the translation-service extraction caller to pass it.
> - **F4-live — glossary `/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** wrapping the Go fact core (append/close/retract/merge/split/
>   fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity) so the KAL writes are real; cross-service KAL→glossary→DB live-smoke.
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff (LLM via provider-registry).
> - **F1g — bi-temporal name/aliases** (§12.4.3) + as-of-name + RECONCILE the cold-start name/aliases representation
>   (supersede the cold-start `attribute` name/alias facts → `name`/`alias` kind facts; the old `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`).
> - **In-story dates (must build — user pulled into v1):** detected in-story time (`event_date_iso`) as an additional KG
>   valid-time source (spec §9 dec-3). Knowledge-service.
> - **Fanout X1–X7 (in-branch):** migrate composition, chat, lore-enrichment, translation, wiki, FE to read/write through
>   the KAL; kill every direct EAV/KG read; flip BOTH INV-KAL lints (table-read + HTTP-surface) to ENFORCING.
>
> **▶ /review-impl (2026-06-30) — 7 findings, ALL FIXED (no HIGH):** MED-1 same-ordinal single-valued conflict → last-write-wins supersede + deterministic projection tiebreak (`TestFactSameOrdinalConflict`); MED-2 unenforced chain-lock → strengthened contract doc + `TestFactChainLockSerializes` (same-chain blocks, disjoint free); LOW-2 cold-start ordinal `0→-1` (chapter_index is 0-based); LOW-5 targeted `ON CONFLICT` on the natural-key expression index; LOW-3 `refreshEAVProjection` attr_def_id-coupling doc; LOW-4 `reconcileEpisode` F1d-obligation doc + now exercised; LOW-1 → `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE` above. All 3 facts tests green on real DB; cold-start re-verified `projection==flat_eav` 0 mismatches with the `-1` sentinel.

# ▶▶ (prior) **Motif book-collaboration tier (model B) + shared-graph links + MCP edit SHIPPED** · branch `feat/narrative-pattern-library` · HEAD `8c4c45c2`+ · 2026-06-29

> **▶ MERGE 2026-06-29:** `origin/main` merged into this branch (179 commits — the **public-MCP gateway + lazy tool-loading** track, critical-UX fixes, glossary/knowledge/campaign work). Conflicts resolved (composition `actions.py` confirm = JWT-identity ∪ public-MCP spend-attribution; engine `plan.py`/`stitch.py` signatures = both; studio panels = `canonview` ∪ `motifs`/`conformance`; gateway test `mcpPublicGatewayUrl`). The motif MCP tools are exposed to the public-MCP gateway: `find_tools` (lazy discovery) picks them up dynamically from the federation catalog, and they are classified in the edge `TOOL_POLICY` allowlist (commit `2aa65765`). Below is this branch's motif work; the merged-in main tracks + all prior history are archived (see the pointer at the bottom).

> **▶ Follow-up this session (2nd commit) — both model-B deferrals CLOSED:** `D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER` (shared-graph link editing — guard rewrite + repo/MCP book_id paths) and `D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED` (the `composition_motif_patch` MCP edit tool). Details in the "Deferred … BOTH NOW CLEARED" block below. 150 motif unit tests + 38 motif DB integration tests green; migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`; provider-gate clean.

> **▶ Shipped this session — the two NEW future-feature rows (now CLOSED):**
> - **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER` (model B) — a THIRD tenancy tier (the book SHARED library).** Spec: [docs/specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md](../specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md). A `motif.book_shared=true` row is owned by its creator (attribution) but VISIBLE to the book's VIEW-grantees and WRITABLE by its EDIT-grantees — access is the **book grant resolved at the caller**, never row ownership. User decisions (this session): **context-scoped reads** (per-book gate, no global "all my books"), **any-EDIT-grantee writes** (edit + archive), **adopt + create + mine** all produce shared rows. The base read predicate is **UNCHANGED** (a foreign shared row is fail-closed invisible to get_visible/list_for_caller/catalog/get_by_codes); shared rows surface ONLY through the gated book-context methods. Touch-points: schema (`book_shared` col + `motif_book_shared_shape` CHECK [shared ⇒ book+owner+private, the public-catalog-orthogonality guard] + per-book `uq_motif_book_shared` + re-narrowed `uq_motif_user_book WHERE …AND NOT book_shared`); repo (`clone/adopt/create/_clone_with_code` thread book_shared; new `list_in_book/get_in_book/patch_shared/archive_shared`; adopt locks per-BOOK + dedups per-(book,code) for the shared tier); MCP (`adopt target=book_shared`, `create target=book_shared`, `mine promote_target=book_shared`, `archive book_id=`, new `composition_motif_book_list`); confirm dispatch (`book_shared` rides the payload, re-gated EDIT); FE (3rd adopt target "Share with collaborators" + `Shared` badge).
> - **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK` — HTTP parity.** `POST /motifs/{id}/adopt` now takes `target=user|book|book_shared`+`book_id`, **EDIT-gated before the clone** (no softer than MCP); `GET /motifs/book/{id}` (VIEW-gated list); `PATCH`/`DELETE …?book_id=` (EDIT-gated shared edit/archive, visibility-flip refused 400). A book-shared pattern root does NOT auto-adopt its members (the half-shared-pattern guard).
>
> **VERIFY:** 90 motif unit tests + new repo/mcp/router cases green; **integration (real PG)**: new `test_motif_book_shared_db.py` (shape CHECK, per-book dedup, list/get scoping, any-grantee patch/archive) + 32 existing motif DB tests pass on a throwaway DB; **migration live-smoked idempotent on the REAL existing model-A `loreweave_composition`** (added book_shared col + CHECK + uq_motif_book_shared + re-narrowed uq_motif_user_book; two runs, no error). FE 152 motif tests + tsc + provider-gate clean. **`/review-impl` adversarial tenancy review: 0 HIGH / 0 MED** — all 9 read/write/leak/confirm/dedup checks PASS with file:line evidence; 3 LOW/COSMETIC notes (deferred below).
>
> **▶ Deferred (from the model-B review — BOTH NOW CLEARED 2026-06-29):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER`** — **CLEARED:** the `motif_link_guard` was rewritten (NULL-safe) to a precise 3-arm same-tier rule — both SYSTEM, or both the SAME book's SHARED tier (owners may differ — the point of a collaborator graph), or both the SAME user's PRIVATE tier. A shared↔private/system/cross-book link is rejected at the DB. Repo `list_links/create_link/delete_link` gained a `book_id` path (anchor via get_in_book; both endpoints must be `book_shared AND book_id`); MCP link tools take `book_id` (VIEW for list, EDIT for create/delete). Live-PG tested (same-book allowed, 3 cross-tier rejections, 3rd-grantee list/delete) + migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`. **Caught+fixed a SQL three-valued-logic bug**: `owner = owner` with a NULL operand yields NULL so `IF NOT NULL` wouldn't fire (a user→system link would have slipped) — every arm is now NULL-guarded.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED`** — **CLEARED:** new `composition_motif_patch` MCP tool (Tier-A) — owner-keyed by default, or a SHARED-tier edit with `book_id` (EDIT-gated → patch_shared). Optimistic-lock `expected_version` (stale → applied_conflict), visibility/publish deliberately NOT editable (separate flow), honest undo that patches changed fields back to prior values. Owner path denies a foreign row before any write; shared path confirms the row is shared-in-this-book.

> # ▶▶ (prior) **Motif library COMPLETE — audit 7/7 closed (WI-1…WI-6)** · HEAD `04bab448`+ · 2026-06-29

> **What this branch is:** the narrative-pattern (motif/arc) library — Tier-W cost-gated MCP flows for mining, conformance, adopt, and 3-way publish-sync, fronted by the FE→MCP-tool bridge. The feature body landed across prior sessions; this session closed the **completeness-audit tail** AND shipped **WI-5 per-book adopt**.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (all green — 1083+ backend unit + 151 FE motif tests, tsc + provider-gate clean):**
> - **Audit tail (committed `f1157b25`…`b8f0ddb3`):** BYOK model_ref threading through `motif_mine`/`arc_import`; the **tag-beats LLM extractor** (knowledge `POST /internal/extraction/tag-beats` → composition mine pre-pass; cross-tenant injection neutralized); **WI-3 arc semantic retrieve** (`composition_arc_suggest`); **WI-1/WI-2/WI-4 FE** (mine panel, full editor, publish-sync); `/review-impl` fixes (arc back-fill scoped to own/system; editor edit-loss). Completeness audit: [`docs/reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md`](../reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md).
> - **WI-5 per-book adopt (`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-PER-BOOK`) — model A "book-scoped filter" (user-chosen, NOT the tier-reversal):** `motif.book_id` is a per-book LABEL on a clone the adopter still owns. The read predicate + 2-tier tenancy are **UNCHANGED** (book_id only narrows the owner's view, never widens visibility). Design: [`docs/plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md`](../plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md). Touch-points: schema (`book_id` col + `uq_motif_user` scoped to `book_id IS NULL` + new `uq_motif_user_book` partial + `idx_motif_book`); `MotifRepo.clone/adopt/_clone_with_code/list_for_caller`; `_MotifAdoptArgs.target=Literal['user','book']`+`book_id` (EDIT-gated at propose **and** confirm); FE adopt-to-book toggle (api/hook/AdoptTargetModal/MotifLibraryView). **Live-smoked** on real `loreweave_composition`: migration idempotent; global+per-book coexist; same-book dup blocked by `uq_motif_user_book`; 0 leaked rows.
> - **WI-6 motif_link edge-walk (`D-MOTIF-LINK-EDGEWALK`) — the FINAL §5 gap, closing the audit 7/7:** 3 MCP tools — `composition_motif_link_list` (R, traverse out/in/both with neighbor code+name), `composition_motif_link_create` + `_delete` (A). User-scoped; WRITE requires **BOTH endpoints owned by the caller** (the system↔system hole the DB `motif_link_guard` same-tier check misses — a user may never reshape the shared graph). `MotifRepo.list_links/create_link/delete_link`. **Live-smoked**: own→own create/list/delete OK; own→system rejected by the guard; 0 leaked rows. The completeness audit is now **7/7 closed, nothing deferred**.
>
> **⚠ Two already-built misfires earlier this session** (memory [[verify-built-before-building]]): `D-W8-MOTIF-BEAT-EXTRACTOR` and `D-MOTIF-SYNC-3WAY-BASE` backend were **already shipped** — I rebuilt a duplicate sync router and reverted it (`a24d99ea`). **Before building ANY "missing"/deferred motif item: `git grep` the route/module/test first.**
>
> **▶ NEXT:** **PR `feat/narrative-pattern-library` → main** — the feature body + audit tail + WI-5 are complete, green, and live-smoked. (Note: the WI-5 migration was applied to the *running* dev `loreweave_composition` by the live-smoke; a fresh stack picks it up from `migrate.py` on boot.)
>
> **▶ Deferred (motif — the §5 audit tail is 7/7 CLOSED; these were NEW future-feature rows):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** model B shipped (see the top block). The shared book tier landed with a 0-HIGH/0-MED adversarial tenancy review.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** the HTTP adopt route exposes `target`+`book_id`, EDIT-gated (see the top block).
