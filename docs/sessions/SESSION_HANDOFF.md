# ▶▶ NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE — **CONTEXT BUDGET LAW — IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS on branch `feat/context-budget-law` (off merged main), 2026-07-04. STANDING RULES (autonomous run): test-model = local `google/gemma-4-26b-a4b-qat` (12b is 8K, too small); DEFER-DON'T-BLOCK (anything needing the user's judgment → a Deferred row here + continue, never hard-stop); quality-gate = a judge subagent CHATS the live agent + scores a rubric + writes an md report ([`docs/specs/context-budget-quality-gate.md`](../specs/context-budget-quality-gate.md)) → decide PASS/REGRESS/NEEDS-HUMAN; durability = git commits + spec §8a + this block (on resume: `git log --oneline`, spec §8a, the todo list); REVIEW-IMPL GATE = every todo item gets a cold-start adversarial review (parallel subagents) before it's marked done → fix HIGH/MED now, defer the rest (tracked here). DONE (committed): T0 wire-hygiene (−3.6% real), T1-flagship response-contract (outline −74%/−99% live + jobs_list + kit helper `apply_response_contract` + worst-first manifest), T2 task-elastic target + meter accuracy (live gate ±22% safe-high), T4-SUBSTRATE (`chat_session_blocks` + `story_state` + OCC, real-PG tested). REVIEW-IMPL GATE applied to T0/T1/T2/T4 (4 cold-start review subagents, commit `5706295a0`): all MED fixed (T0 meter over-counted VI/CJK; T1 get_outline_node had no IDOR test + was missing from the public-MCP allowlist; T4 distill blew the token cap 2-3× for CJK/VI) + cheap LOWs; only the T2 FE↔BE breakdown-vocab drift deferred → Inspector-FE. **⚠ DEFERRED — EVAL-BOOK GAP (D-EVAL-BOOK, gate #4 blocked-on-infra→BUILDABLE):** no dev-DB book currently has agent-retrievable KG lore (POC books have no knowledge project; `entity_canonical_snapshots` + knowledge passages are EMPTY globally, incl. Dracula). The quality-gate's *answer-correctness* A/B needs a lore-populated book → must SEED one (extraction pipeline; scripts `run_dracula_fresh_journey_kg.py`/`seed_fengshen_demo.py`). Unblocks: the T5 answer-correctness judge run + the harness real A/B. NOT blocked: T5 gate-decision correctness + token-savings smoke (a no-lore MESSAGE skips build_context regardless of book lore). NOW: quality-gate harness CODE (driver+judge+report — smoke-able on any session) → T5 grounding intent-gate (+T4 wiring: skip build_context on no-lore turns, project `story_state` net) validated by gate-decision + token-savings; answer-correctness deferred to D-EVAL-BOOK. Family B (MCP SET tools) + Inspector + §13 are fully unblocked in parallel. REMAINING (maximal scope, user-approved 2026-07-04): **B** = ALL ~28 MCP SET tools reference-first + contract-snapshot harness + live-e2e each; **T3** = extract Planner/Compiler → `sdks/python/loreweave_context` kernel (reuse STANDARD, byte-identical, retire the roleplay byte-copy coupling); **T6** = atom-safe collapse + resume-monotonic + fact-preserving summary + `conversation_search` + flip compaction to the target; **Inspector GUI** (dockable studio panel + BE TraceSpan telemetry + `context-trace.contract.json`, §11 86-item checklist); **§13** full enforcement (CI meta-check unproven=red + adversarial refute-pass). THEN the Cursor-for-novels register [[writing-studio-fragmented-not-underbuilt]]. Tier-by-tier measured detail lives in spec §8a. ▼ superseded design-seal note (that prior work merged to main): CONTEXT-MANAGEMENT DESIGN SEALED 2026-07-03 (spec-only; implementation is a NEW SESSION + NEW BRANCH per the user). Spec: [`docs/specs/2026-07-03-context-budget-law.md`](../specs/2026-07-03-context-budget-law.md) v2 + memory [[context-budget-law-and-kernel]]. Root pain: the chat agent has NO per-request context planning — one real turn ("change scene status to drafting") cost 146K tokens (composition_list_outline dumps the whole outline; json.dumps ensure_ascii=True → Vietnamese \uXXXX 2-3×; full skill bodies + blind RAG for a turn needing neither). Deliverables designed: a repo-wide Context Budget Law SPLIT BY ENFORCEABILITY (L3 concise-wire = lint now; L1/L2 reference-first+detail/fields/limit = contract-snapshot tests + versioned default flip; L4/L5/L6 = compiler behavior), Planner(policy) vs Compiler(mechanism), 13 decisions folded from 2 cold-start adversarial reviews, a tier build T0–T6 with per-tier GATES (T0 ensure_ascii=false is shippable NOW & measurable on the 146K replay; committed T0–T3, re-decide T4–T6 after T0–T2 numbers), a reusable Context Kernel STANDARD (`sdks/python/loreweave_context`, ports via provider-registry, uniform TraceSpan telemetry — chat is consumer #1, role-play #2 [roleplay-service is thin Rust delegating to chat-service via a byte-compatible working_memory_seed], composition packer #3), and a dockable Inspector GUI (draft `design-drafts/context-management/context-compiler-inspector.html` + §11 86-line item-level BE/FE checklist; the TraceSpan telemetry is NEW BE work beyond today's context_breakdown). ▶ CURSOR-FOR-NOVELS REGISTER (north-star, don't drift) in [[writing-studio-fragmented-not-underbuilt]]: after context-mgmt, return to (1) merge the 2 workspaces, (2) pass editorContext in ComposePanel so propose_edit works in studio, (3) fill the Lane-B reconciler stub, (4) autonomy mission-control GUI, + Compose grouping/launcher, discuss→content, [[llm-client-first-tool-refactor]], C6 setDone-before-await shared-card refactor.** Prior: **C6 HUNK-REVIEW ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-03 — the last RAID FE tail item is cleared. The `propose_edit` card now lets the user accept/reject INDIVIDUAL changes of an AI-proposed rewrite instead of all-or-nothing Apply. Pure FE, no contract/backend change. New pure helper `features/chat/utils/proseHunks.ts` — SENTENCE-granularity diff (ProseMirror hands the selection space-joined via `textBetween(...,' ')`, so line-granularity is impossible; sentence reads naturally for prose; Latin+CJK splitter with a lowercase-next guard for dialogue/abbrev; reuses wikiDiff `diffLines` LCS) → hunks → `reconstruct(accepted)`. ProposeEditCard renders per-hunk old/new with checkboxes (default accept-all); Apply writes the reconstructed merge, accept-all stays byte-identical to the old whole-text path, reject-all routes to Dismiss. Applies to `replace_selection` only; `insert_at_cursor`/no-selection fall back to the whole-text card. /review-impl (cold-start subagent) found 1 HIGH + 2 fixed + 1 deferred: HIGH — a partial accept flattened the NEW proposal's paragraph breaks to single spaces (accept-all preserved them) → reconstruct now carries a per-unit `breakAfter` and rejoins with `\n\n` at NEW-side paragraph seams. MED — mount-snapshot selection vs live selection: a partial merge re-injects OLD sentences, so Apply now re-checks the live selection still equals the mount snapshot and aborts with a toast on drift (no stale-range splice; run stays suspended for a re-ask). LOW — reject-all→Dismiss moved ABOVE the editor/chapter guards (dismissing needs no editor). DEFERRED (tracked): the optimistic `setDone`-before-`await submitToolResult` with no `catch` is a PRE-EXISTING shared pattern across every propose/confirm card (RecordDiffCard, ConfirmCard, …) — fixing it correctly (retry-RESUME-only, since the doc is already mutated) is a cross-card refactor, out of scope for C6. VERIFY: proseHunks 15 + ProposeEditCard 7 + full chat suite 438 green · tsc clean. FE-only (entirely under frontend/). The LLM-CLIENT-FIRST REFACTOR remains the user-chosen NEXT (new session; memory [[llm-client-first-tool-refactor]]).** Prior: **4-DEBT /review-impl HARDENING DONE 2026-07-03 (content on remote; my labeled commit was dropped as a duplicate on rebase after the concurrent agent-registry track swept the index — the FIXES ARE LIVE, verify by grep not by commit message). 4 adversarial reviewers over the 4 debts: 1 HIGH + 8 MED, all verified-then-fixed. HIGH: C1 steering list is a {items,total} ENVELOPE the FE consumed as a bare array → panel CRASHED on every load (mock-only-coverage trap; api.list now unwraps .items + a transport-level contract test). MED: (8) reorder race (NULL-all now locks ALL owner rows — the `IS NOT NULL` predicate locked nothing when all-NULL → concurrent corruption; + dedupe); (8) ModelPicker now flat-renders in server order when ANY model is ordered (favorites-hoist + provider-grouping were discarding the custom order); (5) context-history limit ge=1 (negative→500), CATEGORY_HEX⇄COLORS lockstep pin, useContextHistory race-guard + stale-clear, History tab mounted-hidden so enabled gates the fetch; C6 TurnCheckpoints filters to the CURRENT chapter (stale other-chapter row silently restored the wrong chapter), capture() TOCTOU closed via a sync-held latestRevIdRef, revKey bump + first-snippet fold; C1 code-point char count + 403 "no permission" message. VERIFY: FE 1262 (182 files) + tsc clean · chat 735 · provider-registry go (DB-gated reorder incl. dedupe). The LLM-CLIENT-FIRST REFACTOR is DEFERRED to a NEW SESSION per the user (memory [[llm-client-first-tool-refactor]]).** Prior: **4 DEBTS CLEARED 2026-07-03 (`1302d9f55` + 3 prior; 3 parallel sub-agents + C6 by hand). The user decided NOT to wait for the (still-active) studio track — the dockable migration is long done + the panel catalog is now additive-safe, so C6/C1 were built directly. (8) MODEL sort_order: `user_models.sort_order` + `PUT /user-models/reorder` + ModelOrderCard drag-reorder (favorites-first fallback; DB-gated live). (5) TOKEN HISTORY chart: `GET /sessions/{id}/context-history` over the persisted context_breakdown JSONB + a recharts Now/History tab on the ContextBreakdownPanel. C1 STEERING panel: features/steering CRUD + dockview SteeringPanel + catalog entry + `steering` added to the ui_open_studio_panel enum (contract JSON + frontend_tools.py + test pins). C6 TURN-CHECKPOINTS: useTurnCheckpoints captures the pre-edit revision at all 3 AI-apply seams (onAccept/applyPolish/popout-relay) → TurnCheckpoints UI above RevisionHistory restores "before the agent touched it" (pure FE over the existing restore spine; ChapterEditorPage not hot in the studio track). VERIFY: chat 734 · provider-registry go (DB-gated) · FE full sweep 181 files/1251 tests · tsc clean. REMAINING: C6 hunk-review (per-hunk accept on the propose_edit card — separate surface, deferred). NEXT (user-chosen): the big LLM-CLIENT-FIRST TOOL REFACTOR (memory [[llm-client-first-tool-refactor]]) — make every agent tool self-describing/enum-in-schema/tolerate-extras/self-correcting/explicit-context, the Frontend-Tool Contract swept across the whole MCP surface.** Prior: **W0 TOOL-ERROR SOAK ✅ DONE 2026-07-03 (`632077380`): baseline reconfirmed 27.7% over 30d (glossary_book_patch 58.5% = the base_version 409 storm = ~22% of ALL errors). The base_version root cause is ELIMINATED — deterministic live proof through chat→gateway→glossary: read emits base_version on all 13 kinds, patch round-trips one-shot, stale→409 WITH current version, OCC bump real again; the fresh-window storm = 0. The soak CAUGHT a systemic residual: the go-sdk infers additionalProperties:false on every MCP tool struct, so a weak model's harmless EXTRA field hard-fails validation before the handler runs — live-caught on glossary_book_patch's `changes` tolerance shim (gemma's `old_value` killed it) AND glossary_propose_batch (100%-error tool; stray root `type` + op-item extras). Fixed via `relaxAdditionalProps` (opens additionalProperties on model-constructed object/array schemas; ENUMS stay strict) + 2 schema tests + 2 deterministic live proofs. Remaining soak tail: fresh-window sample is small (gemma non-deterministic); residual errors are model hallucination (wrong codes) which is inherent — a longer real-usage soak will show the true steady-state (target <10%).** Prior: **WAVE /review-impl HARDENING ✅ SHIPPED 2026-07-03 (`3ce92d101` chat-surface + `6036dfc6a` MCP-surface; 4 parallel adversarial reviewers, every finding VERIFIED against code before fixing): 3 HIGH — (1) edit-below-compact-boundary made user messages INVISIBLE to the model → clear-compact-on-edit + branch-scoped assistant seq; (2) glossary reads NEVER emitted `base_version` (the W0 shim had become the MAIN path = silent overwrite of concurrent human edits; the 22% error bucket was a broken CONTRACT) → reads/creates emit it, OCC loop DB-proven completable end-to-end; (3) session reasoning "off"/"auto" crashed every tool-approval RESUME (raw session vocab ≠ wire vocab) → `_resolve_and_stash_reasoning` on all 3 paths (fresh/resume/voice). 13 MED fixed: Deep-effort persistence via the panel contract ({reasoning_effort, thinking:null}), manual-compact race-guard 409 + `{"clear":true}` escape for poisoned summaries + FE button, ModelPicker recents cross-USER pref pollution (per-user cache keys), serverKey FE/BE pinned to contracts/frontend-tools.contract.json, gateway 408/429/-32603→retryable, `kg_project_list` added to the public tool policy (the self-correct directive pointed at a denied tool), settings_model_set_default parity via shared defaultModelCapQuery, rack 0-tok flash, toast late-join replay, edit_attribute stale-error embeds current version, sanitizer host:port redaction, enum VALUE-SET pins.

> **(2) `D-REG-P5-SUBAGENT-WRITE-DELEGATION` ✅ SHIPPED `61a617094`+`f523c86f6` (defer CLEARED).** A capability audit (2
> Explore agents, evidence-backed) confirmed the architecture is "strict data boundary + absolute enforcement AT THE TOOL
> LAYER": every MCP tool re-auths the `X-User-Id`+internal-token envelope + grant-gates scope (never a model arg;
> `ForbidExtra`), and Tier-W/destructive/priced ops are **mint→browser-JWT-confirm only** (structurally unrunnable from a
> loop). So the read-only subagent clamp was a *conservative default, not the security boundary* — a subagent write is safe
> by construction (bounded to the caller's tenant + its `tool_scope`). **Dropped the heavy nested-suspend/two-level-resume
> spec** as over-engineered; shipped the SIMPLER "allowlisted Tier-A, no suspend": `clamp_permission_mode = min(caller,
> write)`; fixed the plain-path tier resolution (was hardcoded "R" → would've let a subagent auto-commit ANY Tier-A); a
> write sub-run auto-commits ALLOWLISTED Tier-A, but un-allowlisted Tier-A / require_approval-hook / the volume-cap all
> return a `result.error` (headless sub-run can't raise the card) instead of a swallowed suspend. `/review-impl` caught the

> **▶ EXTERNAL-MCP INTEGRATION — FULL LOOP LIVE-PROVEN end-to-end (2026-07-03).** Registered a REAL free public MCP
> server (**DeepWiki** `https://mcp.deepwiki.com/mcp`, no-auth) on the test account and drove the whole chain live:
> **register** (SSRF pass · egress-allowlist auto · transport auto `streamable_http` · namespace `u_a2bbc662_`) → **scan**
> (health 3 tools · injection-scan clean · auto-active) → **federation** → **model autonomously calls it** → **dispatch to
> the real server** → **result rendered in the agent's answer**. The live test found + fixed **two real consumer-wiring
> bugs** (both committed, tested):
> **(a) `fix(chat): wire the per-user overlay into the turn catalog` `a5cf762ec`** — `get_tool_definitions()` sent no
> `X-User-Id` + cached process-wide, so the ai-gateway federation overlay (REG-P2-03, `u_/b_/s_` external tools) NEVER
> reached a real chat turn's LLM. Fix: pass `user_id` (→ `X-User-Id`) + PER-USER cache with a 60s TTL (`_TOOL_CATALOG_TTL_S`;
> overlays differ per user + change on register/remove). Both turn callers updated.
> **(b) `fix(chat): accept plain-text results from external overlay tools` `e1932b40c`** — `mcp_execute_tool` `json.loads()`
> every result, but external tools return PLAIN TEXT (DeepWiki returns prose) → every external result died as "unparseable
> content". Fix: on decode-fail, if the tool matches `_OVERLAY_TOOL_RE` (`^[ubs]_[0-9a-f]{8}_`) wrap as `{"text":…}` success;
> internal tools stay strict-JSON. **Final live turn (Gemma-4 26B): MODEL_CALLED_DEEPWIKI=True, DISPATCH_OK=True**, the real
> wiki structure of `modelcontextprotocol/servers` rendered in the reply. 78 chat-service tests green for these.
> **Ops note:** the overlay is flag-gated — `REGISTRY_OVERLAY_ENABLED=true` (default false, a rollout gate). Set via shell
> env at `docker compose up` time (NOT persisted; a stack recreate without the env reverts to false — add to `.env`/compose
> for permanence). CAVEAT: `docker compose up -d <svc>` re-evaluates `${VAR:-false}` for dependencies, so it can silently
> flip the gateway's overlay off — set the env in the SAME shell. The overlay dispatch also has a circuit-breaker that trips
> under repeated hammering of a flaky free server (fail-open → no overlay that turn); a gateway recreate resets it.

> an OCC stale-version conflict (refetch→retry) — the schema/error-message contracts held. **5 live-caught fixes
> shipped en route (each unit-regression-tested):**
> 1. **Studio nav-kill** — the chat's generic C-NAV executor ran inside the Compose panel; an agent `ui_open_book`
>    on the CURRENT book navigated the SPA to `/books/{id}`, unmounting the WHOLE studio and orphaning the agent's
>    own resumed run (response lost). Fix: `UiNavInterceptorContext` seam in `useUiToolExecutor` +
>    `makeStudioNavInterceptor` (same-book `ui_open_chapter`→`focusManuscriptUnit`, same-book `ui_open_book`/
>    `ui_navigate`→already-here success; cross-book falls through) provided by ComposePanel.
> 2. **book→project bridge** — `composition_get_work` now also accepts `book_id` (resolve_by_book, 0→H13 deny,
>    >1→candidates); the model had dead-ended retrying the book_id AS a project_id (no tool bridged them).
> 3. **CTX-1 position pointer** — `studio_context` now carries `project_id` + `active_chapter_id` (FE: stable
>    `ManuscriptUnitMeta` context — no per-keystroke chat re-render; BE: `StudioContext` model + the system-message
>    note "this book's project is project_id=… (a book_id is NOT a project_id)").
> 4. **composition hot-domain** — the studio compose surface now seeds `composition_*` HOT (`_STUDIO_HOT_DOMAINS`,
>    fresh + resume paths); before, the family was find_tools-lazy and the local model spun in memory/glossary
>    searches concluding "no list_scenes tool exists".
> 5. **Lane-B envelope unwrap** — `chapterIdFromResult` read `chapter_id` top-level but the live stream delivers the
>    chat-service `{ok, result}` TOOL_CALL_RESULT envelope (inner result may be a JSON string) → Scene Rail never
>    reloaded while the DB was already updated (unit tests fed the payload unwrapped — the
>    cross-boundary-normalization bug class, again).
> Also: `manuscriptUnitDocument` TS narrow fix; json-editor empty-buffer-seed commit that was missed from
> `c8906f07a` landed as `a92f10217`. Residual (tracked, not studio-scoped): C-NAV navigation on the PLAIN /chat
> surface still unmounts that page mid-run (same orphaned-resume class — chat-service persists nothing for the
> continuation); intermediate multi-tool turns render "No response generated" chips (cosmetic); knowledge indicator

> `design-drafts/screens/studio/screen-writing-studio-frame.html`. Shipped the full **fixed frame** as
> `features/studio/` (MVC): `StudioTopBar` (back·title·⌘P palette placeholder·settings), `StudioActivityBar`
> (icon rail: Manuscript/Bible/Search/Quality — switches the navigator; re-click active = collapse),
> `StudioSideBar` (active navigator, **content STUBBED**), `StudioDock` (dockview + Welcome + per-book layout
> persistence), `StudioBottomPanel` (toggle; Jobs/Generation/Issues stubs), `StudioStatusBar` (lang·⌘P·bottom
> toggle). Hooks: `useStudioChrome` (activeView/sidebar/bottom, per-book `lw_studio_chrome_<bookId>`) +
> `useStudioLayout` (dockview onReady+persist). **Verified:** tsc+eslint clean, studio i18n ×4 parity-clean,

> See memory `[[editor-workmode-and-compose-must-keep-editor-mounted]]`.

> **▶ Writing Studio (v2) — BLANK SHELL shipped 2026-07-01 (branch `feat/writing-studio`, FE-only).** A NEW,
> from-scratch surface — does NOT touch `ChapterEditorPage`. **Build-vs-buy decided:** our in-house dock layer
> (`WorkspaceLayoutProvider`/`DockRail`/`FloatingWindow`/`PopoutBridge`) is a single linear tab-rail — it CANNOT
> do VS Code-style multi-region docking (splits, tab groups, nested regions, drag-split-merge). Adopted
> **`dockview-react` v7.0.2** (zero-dep, MIT, React-18, real tab-groups + split grids + floating groups + pop-out
> windows + `toJSON/fromJSON`). **Shipped:** `pages/WritingStudioPage.tsx` (empty dockview shell, `themeAbyss`,
> single Welcome panel, **per-book layout persistence** via `localStorage` `lw_studio_layout_<bookId>` on
> `onDidLayoutChange`); route `/books/:bookId/studio` under `EditorLayout`; **book-level** "Studio" CTA in
> `BookDetailPage` header (opens directly, no chapter needed); new i18n `studio` ns × en/vi/ja/zh-TW +
> `books.detail.open_studio`. **Verified:** tsc + eslint clean, production `vite build` OK (dockview bundles),
> browser-smoke — studio renders, welcome panel, layout persists (1 panel saved), 0 console errors, CTA links
> correctly. **Architecture rule carried forward:** live/in-flight state (co-writer streams, editor docs) must
> live ABOVE dockview; panels are thin views over hoisted state so closing/moving a panel never drops work —
> wire when the first stateful panel lands. **Next:** user directs which panel to add first (compose, planner,
> cast, quality…), one at a time. See memory `[[editor-workmode-and-compose-must-keep-editor-mounted]]`.

> **▶ GUI Workmode overhaul (M0 + M1 + Read) — SHIPPED 2026-07-01 (FE-only).** The chapter editor's
> "three overlapping hidden mode systems" collapse into ONE dropdown: **Write · Translate · Read · Compose**
> (`hooks/useWorkmode.ts` persisted `lw_editor_workmode`; `components/editor/WorkmodeSwitcher.tsx`). Folded
> away the scattered Pen/Sparkles toggle (now a Write-only sub-control), the Co-write bridge, the one-shot
> `handleTranslate` button (deleted), the view-translations Eye button, and the compose right-panel tab.
> **Center swaps by mode:** Write/Compose keep the manuscript editor mounted (Compose shows the studio in the
> right companion panel — the editor MUST stay mounted or the studio's insert/applyPolish ref no-ops:
> regression-tested); Translate embeds the full **`ChapterTranslationsPanel`** (extracted from
> `ChapterTranslationsPage`, which is now a thin wrapper seeding `?lang=`/`?vid=`); **Read** opens the
> existing full `ReaderPage` route (guarded) — reader already reads the draft with TTS/theme/TOC/lang-switch,
> so it's reused, not rebuilt. i18n `editor.workmode.*` × en/vi/ja/zh-TW. E2E page-object `openComposeTab`
> updated to drive the dropdown. **Tests:** useWorkmode 4 + WorkmodeSwitcher 4 + ChapterEditorPage 5 (incl.
> the Compose-keeps-editor-mounted regression guard); translation/composition/editor/pages/hooks **853 green**,
> tsc + eslint clean. **Not done:** live browser-smoke (mocked heavy components ≠ visual proof — do next);
> mobile still uses its own group shell (workmode switch is desktop-only, conscious).

> **▶ Q3 Book-level promise coverage — SHIPPED 2026-07-01.** Reframed from "auto arc-conformance":
> verified `compute_arc_report` hard-requires an `arc_template_id`, and arc templates come ONLY from the
> reference-import (`motif_deconstruct`) / authored path — the mainstream premise→pipeline flow creates
> none (no `work→arc_template` link), so auto arc-conformance is a **no-op for mainstream works** (already
> has a manual Tier-W path). The GUI-free, mainstream-valuable Q3 is the **book-level escalation of the
> promise audit** (v2 API): `quality_report.build_promise_coverage` = `extract_tracked_promises(premise,
> plan_text)` (STABLE set from the SPEC, not the prose) → `score_promise_coverage(full_book)` →
> **paid/progressing/abandoned/absent** + rates. Worker op `promise_coverage` (+ SUPPORTED_OPERATIONS +
> dispatch) + `POST /v1/composition/works/{id}/promise-coverage` (renders `plan_text` from the outline tree
> + assembles every ACTIVE chapter's prose — the ENDPOINT resolves, the worker runs). FE `promiseCoverage`
> api + `useBookPromiseCoverage` + `BookPromiseCoverageSection` in the **project-scoped `QualityPanel`**
> (threaded `modelRef`; NOT the per-chapter Polish gate). Read-only. Also fixed a duplicate `composition-quality`
> testid (QualityReportSection → `composition-quality-report`). **Live smoke** (Gemma-4-26b, vi plan+book):
> 4 tracked promises from the outline; 3 paid + **1 ABSENT** = the outline-promised "missing brother" thread
> the book never delivers — exactly the "does the book pay off the outline?" signal. `err:None`. Tests:
> quality_report 9 + worker_jobs (dispatch+serialize) + FE BookPromiseCoverageSection 5; FE 735 green.
> **Deferred:** `D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-CHUNK` (very long books overflow one score call — window it; gate #4).
> **★ Ceiling note (user):** the rest of the constellation (arc templates, motif library) each need a whole
> **CRUD GUI** — big features to plan separately, not just "wiring". See memory `constellation-wiring-ceiling-crud-guis`.

> **▶ MERGE 2026-06-30: `origin/main` (Temporal-Knowledge / KAL) merged in (55 commits).** The
> knowledge-gateway (**KAL**) unifies glossary/KG reads under INV-KAL: composition's cast-roster read
> moved from `glossary.list_entities` → **`kal.roster()`** (drains the cursor — fixes the ~100-cast
> truncation). Conflict was ONLY `SESSION_HANDOFF.md`; router `plan.py` + `glossary_client.py`
> auto-merged (our `thread_state`/`exit_state`/`seed_entities` survived alongside KAL). Our `seed_entities`
> WRITE (glossary `extract-entities`) passes **both** INV-KAL gates (knowledge-access + http-surface).
> **Verified:** composition unit suite **1209 passed**; `kal.roster()` returns the 10 seeded cast;
> **e2e** on the rebuilt KAL stack — seed → KAL roster → decompose → **34/34 scenes grounded** with
> `present_entity_ids`. Our code is fully on the new standard (roster via KAL; `cast_plan`/`self_heal`
> don't touch glossary directly).


> **What this track is:** the editor/compose UX overhaul **pivoted (PO)** to fixing **output QUALITY first** — POC chapters read as concatenated scenes. Two design docs:
> - **[`docs/specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/`](../specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/)** — the GUI track (validate-first, milestones M0–M5 are a backlog menu, NOT a build order).
> - **[`docs/specs/2026-06-30-chapter-synthesis-self-healing.md`](../specs/2026-06-30-chapter-synthesis-self-healing.md)** — the synthesis track: **Phase 0** (planning connectivity, DO FIRST) → **Phase 2** (multi-pass self-heal). Ordering is locked: garbage-in (disconnected plan) can't be polished out.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (validated, committed):**
> - **Phase 0 slice 1 (intra-chapter connectivity)** — enriched the decompose prompt (goal·conflict·outcome + causality + ending-guided). Fixed the 3 worst reviewer defects (causeless pursuit, grimoire-from-nowhere, disconnected scenes) at the synopsis level, prompt-only.
> - **Phase 0 slice 2 (cross-chapter threading)** — `engine/plan.py`: typed `ChapterExitState` (Character/World/Plot + `advances`) emitted as a same-call delta, threaded chapter→chapter (`thread_state` flag, **default OFF ⇒ today's concurrent fan-out byte-identical**; sequential when ON: prev-chapter exit = fine-grained backbone + cumulative advances = global anti-repeat). Wired through worker + router (additive optional). **Live worker smoke** (Gemma, `thread_state=True`, 12ch/36sc): chapters now open *"Tiếp nối từ…"* the prior exit-state, **arc repetition gone**. `/review-impl`: **0 HIGH**, 4 findings fixed (inline/worker response parity for `exit_state`; both-flags no-op warning; degrade-path test; advances-cap documented). **Tests:** composition unit suite **1180** + slice tests (test_plan 19, router 16, worker_jobs 18 — fixed 5 pre-existing `cancel_check` fake drift) green.
>
> **▶ Self-heal POC — the whole approach was de-risked this session (see the synthesis spec for the data):**
> - **stitch baseline** — the existing 1-pass `stitch` smooths transitions but is NOT a dedup/repair pass, and it **inflates length +68%** (a prompt cleanup did NOT fix it: Gemma rewrites-and-expands by nature; the token cap isn't a clean lever). ⇒ whole-chapter rewrite is the wrong primitive.
> - **L1 dropped** — the "scene-titles mid-chapter" complaint was a POC HARNESS artifact (`to_tiptap_doc` heading-per-scene), not a pipeline defect.
> - **Satellite editing is the answer (PO insight)** — surgical edit of a SMALL isolated span. Mechanism (2) structural isolation works on a small model: `selection-edit` on a 446-char span → ×1.01 length, motif 2→0, meaning preserved (vs whole-chapter ×1.68). Mechanism (1) trust-the-model fails on small models (the stitch result).
> - **The detector must be an LLM JUDGE, not code** (PO) — POC: Gemma returned **7 real findings** (2 logic holes incl. the fall-physics one, emotion-loop, motif, flat villain), each with a `fix` guide, **7/7 locatable (3 exact + 4 fuzzy)** ⇒ the locate step uses **fuzzy/shingle match, not exact**.
> - ⇒ **Full pipeline proven end-to-end:** `LLM JUDGE → fuzzy-locate (code) → satellite-edit (selection-edit) → splice → re-judge loop`. (POC scripts: `poc/judge_poc.py`, harness phases `satellite`/`stitch`.)
>
> **▶ Orchestrator BUILT + live-validated** — `engine/self_heal.py` (`run_self_heal`): judge→fuzzy-`locate_span`→satellite-edit→splice→re-judge; advisory skips (not-located/overlap/runaway-expansion). 12 unit tests. Live on ch1: 6 findings, **6/6 located, 4 edits, length ×1.014** (vs stitch ×1.68), surgical on-target edits. Fixed a false-zero re-judge bug (degraded re-judge now reports None). NOT yet wired to an endpoint (in-container script POC).
>
> **▶ PIVOT (PO) — re-architect PLANNING before drafting.** Reviewing the committed 12-ch plan surfaced many holes at once (no motif binding, empty cast / scene-presence, anonymous new characters, ch1 telescoped). Root cause = `decompose` is **one-shot** (same anti-pattern as whole-chapter stitch). Fix = a multi-step planning pipeline (decompose-and-refine, ONE arc). Spec: [`docs/specs/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline-architecture.md`](../specs/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline-architecture.md) · Build plan + **capability audit** (planning uses ~2/30 engines — the judge constellation promise_audit/succession_entailment/arc_conformance is idle): [`docs/plans/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline.md`](../plans/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline.md). Stages: 0 cast/world · 1 motif-select · 2 arc+tension · 3 char-arc/intro · 4 grounded decompose · 5 plan self-heal · 6 orchestration+checkpoints. Reuse-heavy (motif retriever, templates, arc_apply, self_heal pattern, the idle judges).
>
> **▶ PLANNING PIPELINE COMPLETE (Stages 0–6, all live-validated)** — replaced the one-shot decompose with a multi-step planner, each stage committed + unit-tested + live-POC'd on the Lâm Uyển premise:
> - **0 cast** (`cast_plan.py` propose_cast + `glossary_client.seed_entities`) — 10 cast (6 named + 4 new), seeded → roster → present_entity_ids.
> - **1 motifs** (`motif_plan.py` select_arc_motifs) — 4 arc motifs with roles (spine/recurring/foil/climax).
> - **2 tension** (`arc_plan.py` shape_tension_curve, deterministic) — fixes ch1=100; 100 only at climax.
> - **3 char-arcs** (`character_plan.py` plan_character_arcs) — arcs + introduction schedule (new chars @ fitting beats).
> - **4 grounded decompose** (`grounded_plan.py` + grounding block in `plan.py`) — feeds cast/motifs/tension/intros into the threaded L2.
> - **5 plan self-heal** (`plan_heal.py`) — plan-judge → satellite-edit a scene synopsis by (chapter,scene).
> - **6 orchestration** (`planning_pipeline.py` run_planning_pipeline) — chains 0→1→L1(once)→3→4→5.
> - **Capstone live POC** (`poc/io/full_pipeline.txt`): cast=10 · motifs=4 · arcs=10 · 12ch/30sc/30-with-present · **plan-heal 7/7 findings edited** (4× cross-chapter repetition, a character-before-introduction, a tension-vs-beat, a dangling setup — all real, all fixed).
>
> **▶ Production hardening DONE + the drive STARTED:**
> - **Task A (wired)** — `DecomposeRequest.pipeline=true` → the `/outline/decompose` endpoint runs `run_planning_pipeline` via the worker (`plan_pipeline` op + dispatch + allowlist). **Live e2e:** endpoint→202→worker→cast=9/motifs=4/12ch·35sc/plan-heal 8-8→committed to the outline.
> - **Task B (D-PLAN-CAST-ATTRS, resolved)** — `cast_attributes` maps role/traits/archetype/relationships/summary → the character kind's attr codes; `seed_entities` sends `attributes`+`attribute_actions`. Live-verified: glossary EAV persists role/personality/relationships/description. Drafting grounding now has DEPTH.
> - **Task C (the drive, in progress)** — the full grounded+healed 12-ch plan was generated + committed through the production endpoint; CH1 drafted (grounded) + chapter self-healed (`engine/self_heal.py`) as the prose sample. **NEXT:** draft + self-heal the remaining chapters (drive identically) for the full-story PO evaluation; optional: wire `self_heal` to its own endpoint (currently a script).
> - review-impl on the pipeline: 0 HIGH, 2 MED fixed (motif unrecognised-role drop; L1-once on degrade).
>
> **▶ Cheap quality stack — judge upgrade (SHIPPED 2026-07-01, `engine/self_heal.py`):** the bare judge
> was blind (0 findings on CH1 while real xưng-hô/canon errors stood; confabulated when prompted broad).
> Root cause = no canon grounding, not model size. POC'd 5 layers on the $0 local Gemma (data:
> `poc/io/poc_stack_out.json`), then implemented the validated subset — all **default-OFF ⇒ legacy
> byte-identical**: `canon` (grounds judge **and** satellite editor in a story bible + 2 false-positive
> guards), `vote_k`/`min_votes` (grounded judge ×K, must-quote folded in), `verify` (skeptical
> refute-or-confirm, fail-open), `prefilter` (dup-word + full-recall pronoun findings), `_snap_to_sentence`
> (edit whole sentences ⇒ no splice artifact). **Lesson:** voting alone does NOT kill *systematic*
> confab — only grounding suppresses it + verify refutes the leak. **CH1 re-healed:** 7 defects → near-zero,
> **x0.997**, incl. the canon contradiction (`từng dốc lòng che chở`→`luôn khinh miệt`) fixed by the grounded
> editor; remaining = 1 cosmetic + 1 borderline repetition left for the human/stronger gate. **Tests:**
> self_heal **21** (12 legacy + 9 new) green; full composition unit suite green. Result file:
> `poc/io/ch01_healed_cheapstack.txt`. Spec §"Cheap quality stack".
>   - **Full-book drive (CH1–12, book-level canon of all 9 cast) — `story-export-v2/` + `poc/io/heal_v2_summary.json`:**
>     **modern pronouns `ông/bà/ông ta/bà ta` = 0 real residuals book-wide** (deterministic prefilter is the
>     reliable workhorse); **no inflation anywhere** (x0.998–1.005). Two honest findings: (1) **verify is
>     stochastic + fail-toward-refute → occasionally drops a real finding** (CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` regressed
>     vs the dedicated run; refuted=5/5 on CH03) — a precision/recall knob to tune (lower aggression, or vote
>     the verify), the human gate still matters most for the *semantic* findings. (2) **bug FIXED this commit:**
>     the dup-word collapser would flatten VALID Vietnamese reduplication (`chằm chằm`, `rắc rắc`) — now gated
>     OFF for `_REDUP_LANGS` (vi/zh/ja/ko/th/id/ms); only NFD-diacritic luck spared the v2 corpus, so the
>     exported v2 prose is unaffected.
>   - **(A) verify-recall + (B) canon-from-pipeline — SHIPPED 2026-07-01:**
>     **(A)** `run_self_heal(verify_k=…)` VOTES the verify (`_verify_vote`, majority-refute, tie→keep) so a
>     stochastic single refute can't drop a real finding. **(B)** new `engine/heal_canon.py`
>     (`render_canon` / `convention_for` / `canon_from_proposed`) builds the heal bible from the SAME
>     designed cast drafting grounds on; `PipelineResult.canon` now carries it (rendered in
>     `run_planning_pipeline`). **Live-validated on CH1** ($0 local, canon auto-rendered 2701 chars,
>     `verify_k=3`): the CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` false-refute is **GONE** (residual=False; refuted 4→1), and
>     the rendered canon enabled a new canon catch (Hắc Sát Lão Nhân's role). Tests: self_heal 24 +
>     heal_canon 5.
>   - **⚠ CORRECTION (full-book re-drive, 2026-07-01) — the verify_k=3 "fix" was a lucky dedicated-run
>     sample.** Re-driving CH1–12 (`heal_all_v3.py` → `story-export-v3/` + `poc/io/heal_v3_summary.json`):
>     **pronouns ông/bà = 0 book-wide** (deterministic prefilter — rock-solid), **no inflation** (x0.998–1.007),
>     BUT **CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` STILL residual** (present in both v2 and v3). Two real findings: (1) the
>     verify-vote was **mis-tuned** — majority-refute on a "default-REFUTED" prompt COMPOUNDS the refute-lean
>     (over-refuted: CH11 4/4, CH12 7/7). **Fixed:** `_verify_vote` now drops only on a **UNANIMOUS** refute
>     (keep if any vote confirms) — recall-biased, the human gate culls the rest. (2) **The verify model has a
>     genuine BLIND SPOT on `mẫu thân ngươi`** — it refutes 3/3 even grounded + recall-biased (0 confirms), so
>     NO vote threshold rescues it. **Conclusion (validates the M6 design):** the cheap stack is reliable on
>     CLOSED-CLASS (pronouns/dup, deterministic); semantic blind-spots are real + bounded → that residue is
>     exactly what the **human gate (M6 Polish) + stronger-model escalation** (deferred, story C7 #4) exist for.
>     Track **D-VERIFY-BLINDSPOT-ESCALATE**: wire the stronger-model gate for verify-refuted-but-real findings.
>   - **★ REDESIGN — DIRECT high-recall propose (PO diagnosis, 2026-07-01): the JUDGE pipeline was the bug,
>     not self-heal.** PO proved a BARE prompt on the same Gemma finds 7 splice-ready `{original,replacement,
>     explanation}` edits where our `judge→vote→verify→satellite` chain kept ~4 (verify default-REFUTED muted
>     real edits → v2≈v3). "The model detects + proposes correctly; only the judge is dumb." **Fix shipped:**
>     `propose_self_heal` now uses **`propose_edits_direct`** — ONE high-recall judge call that emits the
>     replacement inline (`build_direct_judge_messages`/`parse_direct_findings`), must-quote locate + dup-word
>     merge, **NO vote/verify** (the human gate IS the filter). Canon is CONTEXT, not a suppression guardrail.
>     **Live CH1:** 5 splice-ready edits incl. `mẫu thân ngươi`→`của ta` AND the canon contradiction
>     `dốc lòng che chở`→`khinh miệt` — the two cases the old pipeline never fixed — in 1 call (vs vote×5+verify×3).
>     Autonomous `run_self_heal` keeps the conservative `_compute_edits`. Tests: self_heal+worker 49 passed.
>   - **★ "Make the judge smart" — (1) surface rules + (2) comparative re-ranker (2026-07-01).** Smart-judge
>     POC pinned the root cause: the verifier wasn't dumb, it was **UNDERFED** — the rule was BURIED in an

>     **~all 14 declines are NO-OPs** (`replacement == original`; the direct auditor emits ~25% of these). The 41

>     PolishPanel 8 (+toggle).
>   - **★ Re-ranker made TYPE-ROUTED (RULE vs CRAFT) — a general judge is weak for novels (2026-07-01).**
>     PO: a general "is it better?" judge is shallow for fiction (quality isn't one axis). POC
>     (`poc/typerouted_compare.py` + `poc/io/typerouted_compare.log`) ran BOTH on all 50 proposals: the
>     **general judge APPLYed 47/50 (94%) — a rubber stamp that would AUTO-DELETE CH04's 8 passages**; the
>     type-routed auto-approved only **10 RULE** fixes (pronouns, `mẫu thân ngươi`, role/genre-term/typo) and
>     deferred **39 CRAFT** to the author + flagged 1 BAD. **Wired:** `_RERANK_SYSTEM` now classifies
>     **RULE** (objective convention/canon/typo/dup-word/grammar → auto-tick) vs **CRAFT** (rephrase/trim/
>     DELETE-passage/pacing/tone → author decides) vs **BAD**; `recommended = (verdict==RULE)`; degrade →
>     not-pre-checked (safe). Passage-deletion forced to CRAFT; RULE bucket widened to include typos (fixed
>     the POC's `món món` miss). Live CH1: all 5 = RULE, each citing the rule. Errs SAFE (defers borderline).
>     Tests: self_heal 31. **NEXT:** stronger-model escalate for the rare true blind spot.
>   - **M6 Polish — BE done (M6.1 engine + M6.2 wiring), 2026-07-01:**
>     **M6.1** (`c4db3792`) — `_compute_edits` shared step ⇒ `propose_self_heal` returns `EditProposal[]`
>     (id/tier deterministic|semantic/start/end/before/after) WITHOUT splicing; `apply_self_heal_edits(accepted_ids)`
>     splices the accepted subset; `run_self_heal` = propose+apply-all (byte-identical).
>     **M6.2** — worker op `self_heal_propose` (+ SUPPORTED_OPERATIONS + dispatch) + REST endpoint
>     `POST /v1/composition/projects/{id}/self-heal/propose` (resolve draft Tiptap→text + canon [override
>     or roster+convention] → propose → proposals; worker/inline like `plan_pipeline`). **Apply reuses the
>     existing `composition_write_prose`** — no new write tool / no confirm-token surgery. **Live-smoke:**
>     resolve path proven on the stack (get_draft `body` key + draft_version=2 → 7473-char prose; KAL roster
>     12 cast → 823-char canon); propose engine separately live-validated. Tests: self_heal 27 + worker_jobs
>     (dispatch + serialize).
>   - **M6.3 FE — DONE (Polish panel), 2026-07-01:** `PolishPanel` + `usePolishProposals` hook + `api.proposeSelfHeal`
>     / `applySelfHealEdits` (JS mirror of the engine splice); registered `polish` in the **Quality** group
>     (`workspace/types.ts` + `CompositionPanel` SubTab/stripIds/DockSlot, no-remount preserved); accept/reject
>     diff list (deterministic pre-checked, semantic unchecked); Apply → `ChapterEditorPage.handleApplyPolish`
>     replaces the doc via `setContent` (mirrors `handleTranslate`). Endpoint path fixed `/projects`→`/works`.
>     i18n `polish` label ×4 locales. Tests: tsc clean + **722 composition vitest** (incl. 6 new).
>     **NEXT:** re-drive CH1–12 with `verify_k=3` to refresh `story-export-v2/`.
>   - **Deferred D-POLISH-FE-BROWSER-SMOKE** (gate #4, needs FE image rebuild) — full click-through (open
>     chapter → Polish tab → Run → proposals → Apply) on a rebuilt FE image (running infra-frontend is the
>     old baked build). BE resolve-path + propose engine already live-smoked; FE↔BE call is typed + unit-tested.
>   - **/review-impl on M6 (2026-07-01):** **HIGH fixed** — stale cross-chapter proposals would Apply onto the
>     wrong chapter; fixed by `key={chapterId}` on PolishPanel (remount resets the snapshot). **MED fixed** —
>     FE `applySelfHealEdits` UTF-16-sliced Python code-point offsets; added a fail-safe (skip when
>     `slice≠before`). Tests: PolishPanel 7 + tsc clean. **Two MED deferred for a PO decision (snapshot
>     tradeoffs of whole-doc replace):** **D-POLISH-OCC** — Apply uses the propose-time `source_text` +
>     ignores `draft_version`, so edits made after Run (incl. unsaved buffer) are lost → compare version &
>     warn, or apply spans to the live doc. **D-POLISH-MARKS** — Apply rebuilds plain paragraphs ⇒ strips
>     inline marks (AI-provenance/bold) chapter-wide (same shape as handleTranslate). Plus LOW: no router
>     test for the propose endpoint.
>   - **Deferred D-SELFHEAL-CANON-ATTRS** (gate #2, structural) — heal canon is currently convention +
>     roster NAMES (KAL roster is names-only); rich per-character canon (descriptions → catches canon
>     contradictions like Tô Yến "che chở") needs a glossary "full cast WITH attributes" read. The
>     convention already grounds the dominant xưng-hô class; attribute-canon is the enrichment follow-up.
>
> **▶ Broader evaluation pass — DONE 2026-07-01 (`tests/e2e/eval_compose_quality.py` + `docs/specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/eval/2026-07-01-quality-eval.md`).** Drove all 3 surfaces × 12 real chapters + book coverage. Verdict: **critic** (10/10 violations real, 0 FP) + **book coverage** (v2, after windowing) are trustworthy; **self-heal** good (49 props, 0 no-ops) but hides its objective wins; the **per-chapter "dropped promises" is a false-positive machine** (30 flagged vs 0 abandoned book-wide — v1 audit mislabels still-*progressing* threads as dropped; the LLM's own "chưa/not-yet" annotations prove it). Ranked backlog below.
>
> **▶ Deferred (this track):**
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-DROPPED-FP**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01 (backlog #1).** The per-chapter Quality Report promise section is reframed from the misleading "dropped promises" alarm to **"threads RAISED in this chapter"** (informational) + any RESOLVED here; the false-positive "dropped" verdict is gone, and the book-level coverage owns paid/abandoned. `quality_report` now returns `{critic, threads:{raised, resolved, raised_count, resolved_count}}` (was `{critic, promises:{...dropped...}}`); `_chapter_threads` reshapes the audit; FE `QualityThreads` + `QualityReportSection` render "N thread(s) raised" (neutral) + "M paid off here" (green). E2E-confirmed (`raised` present, `dropped` absent). Tests: quality_report + worker + FE QualityReportSection updated green.
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-HONORIFIC-PRECHECK**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01 (backlog #2).** Data-driven: re-ran the eval with rerank=ON — the LLM re-ranker only pre-checked **8/15** honorific fixes (misclassifies ~half as CRAFT) at the cost of 49 extra calls. So "default rerank ON" was the WRONG fix. Instead: `self_heal._is_convention_fix(type)` code-detects the objective xưng-hô/address/typo class (a closed convention the auditor labels) and pre-checks it **deterministically + FREE** — even with rerank OFF, and it short-circuits the re-ranker when ON. E2E-confirmed on real ch1: 4/4 ADDRESS/HONORIFIC pre-checked, LOGIC/REPEATED (CRAFT) left unchecked. Tests: self_heal 34 (+3: _is_convention_fix, precheck-without/with-rerank).
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-CRITIC-HEAL-LINK**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01 (backlog #3).** The critic's canon violations ≈ self-heal's honorific edits (same issue, shown as diagnostic AND edit). `QualityReportSection` now takes the current `proposals` and marks each critic violation whose `span` overlaps a proposal's `before` with a **"fix proposed ↓"** badge (`_hasProposedFix`, normalized substring-either-way, min-len guard) — so the author sees "this violation already has a fix below" instead of double-counting. FE-only; PolishPanel passes `p.proposals`. Tests: QualityReportSection +2 (match / no-match); FE composition 737.
> - **D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-VARIANCE — LOW, DEFERRED (backlog #5, conscious).** Book-coverage paid↔progressing flips run-to-run (LM Studio/Gemma isn't fully deterministic even at temp 0). Stabilizing = a multi-sample majority vote per window = 3× the LLM cost for marginal gain on an ADVISORY signal. Gate #4 — fix only if the variance ever misleads a real decision. Trigger: a user reports a promise's verdict flipping confusingly.
> - **D-QUALITY-CH4-REGEN — LOW, NOT-A-CODE-FIX (backlog #4, conscious).** ch4's draft has a repetition LOOP; both critic (coh=2, "looping") and self-heal (10 "repeated") correctly flagged it — i.e. the TOOLS WORK. The resolution is regenerating ch4's DATA (a generation op), not a code change; near-zero product value on one POC chapter. Won't-fix as code; regenerate the draft opportunistically if the POC book is re-driven.
> - **D-QUALITY-MOTIF-ROLLUP** — surface `motif_conformance` beat-not-realized per chapter in the Quality Report (needs per-outline-node motif bindings aggregated across scenes). Gate #2 (structural). Target: a Q-follow-on to the Quality Report track.
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-CHUNK**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01** (found by E2E → fixed → E2E-confirmed, the full loop). `build_promise_coverage` now WINDOWS the book (`_split_windows`, 12K-char paragraph-aligned) and scores each window against the same fixed promise set, MERGING per-promise by strongest engagement (paid > progressing > abandoned > absent); all windows failing → honest `coverage_unavailable`. **E2E-confirmed on the real 12-ch book:** was `coverage_unavailable` + all-10-absent → now `error:None`, 9 promises all **"progressing"** (a sensible read of a setup-heavy opening: promises live, none resolved/dropped yet). Tests: quality_report 12 (+3 windowing) + an E2E regression guard (`error != coverage_unavailable`).
>
> **▶ E2E harness — SHIPPED 2026-07-01 (`9687f6910`), replaces live-smoke/POC (per user).** `tests/e2e/quality_harness.py` + `tests/e2e/test_compose_quality_e2e.py`: drives the REAL `/v1/composition/*` quality endpoints through the gateway as the claude-test account, discovering a real target black-box (books → work → a DRAFTED chapter → chat model) + job-poll. 4 E2E green. First run surfaced (a) a STALE-IMAGE trap (running composition image predated the endpoints → 404; rebuilt composition-service+worker) and (b) the coverage-chunk bug above — both invisible to a crafted-input smoke. **Methodology (LOCKED, see memory `prefer-e2e-and-evaluation-over-live-smoke-poc`):** validate compose-quality via real E2E + evaluation analysis over the real book, not hand-fed smoke. **NEXT:** either fix D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-CHUNK (make Q3 work on real books) or run a broader evaluation pass across all 3 surfaces × 12 chapters to build the improvement backlog.
> - **D-ARC-TEMPLATE-CRUD-GUI / D-MOTIF-LIBRARY-CRUD-GUI** — auto arc-conformance + the motif-library judges are gated on GUI-managed artifacts (arc templates only from reference-import/authored; no `work→arc_template` link). Making them useful needs whole CRUD GUIs — big features. Gate #2 (structural). Target: discuss + plan as their own features.
> - **Recently cleared:** ~~D-QUALITY-ARC-LEVEL~~ — SHIPPED as Q3 (book-level promise coverage, 2026-07-01).
> - **D-THREAD-MOTIF-COMBINED** — `thread_state` + `motifs_enabled` together: typed-state threading is skipped on the motif path (motif `prev_effects` carry used; warned, not silent). Gate #2 (needs interleaving the motif sequential select with the threaded invent loop). Target: when motifs + threading are both wanted in one run.
> - **Book-service universal formatter** (slice 01: `tiptap.go`/`server.go` markdown→Tiptap) — built, **uncommitted**, awaiting the PO's read-mode test before a separate commit.
> - GUI milestones M0–M5 — paused behind the synthesis track (output quality first).

> - **Foundation** (bi-temporal `entity_facts` SSOT, `maintain_chain` single writer, episodes, fold loop, KG

> - **X6 FE:** KAL **dual-auth** (JWT + book grant-check, anti-spoof) + BFF `/v1/kal` route (reviewed + live-verified
>   200/403/401); **6 temporal surfaces** (canonical card, time slider, change timeline, diff, retrieval,

>   "Temporal" tab.
> - **Honest limitations (not bugs, future enhancements):** per-episode translation is now REAL (built this run —

>
> **▶ FOUNDATION FULLY HARDENED + COMPLETE (incl. close_fact).**
>
> **▶ BACKEND FANOUT COMPLETE (X1–X5, X7) — consumers now read bi-temporal knowledge through the KAL; both
> INV-KAL lints ENFORCED:**
> - **X1 composition** `ae4016ea` — `KalClient.roster` DRAINS `next_cursor` (fixes the D4 truncation-at-100 bug);
>   `_cast_roster` migrated; dead `list_entities` removed. 1181 tests green.
> - **X2 lore-enrichment** `9af1c255` — `KalClient` (roster drain + facts/canonical/search); full-book cast from
>   the drained roster. Residual: `kind`/`short_description` supplemented from the authored entity-list (catalog,
>   not bi-temporal — out of INV-KAL scope, like the table-read gate's `glossary_entities` exemption).
> - **X5 translation** `0471b48c` — `KalClient` (get_facts/get_canonical) with **as-of-N inject** (threads
>   `chapter_sort_order`) + **immutable-once cache** (keyed on chapter content-hash + as-of). Default (no
>   `KNOWLEDGE_GATEWAY_URL`) byte-identical to today.
> - **X3 wiki / X4 chat — verified NO-OPs:** wiki is owner-side (glossary, lint-exempt); chat's entity reads are
>   MCP tools federated by name through ai-gateway (MCP-first invariant — must stay that way). No dead code added.
> - **X7** `7fb6e692` — built the INV-KAL **HTTP-surface lint** (was DEFERRED `D-KAL-HTTP-SURFACE-LINT`); BOTH
>   halves now ENFORCED in pre-commit. Both lints PASS full-scan (zero direct bi-temporal knowledge reads in consumers).
> - **KAL in docker-compose** `b695ab7d` — built + healthy in-stack; cross-service smoke: composition container →
>   `knowledge-gateway:3000` roster returns the contract shape.
>
> **▶ X6a/b — FE→KAL bridge DONE + live-verified** `bf772913` (PO: dual-auth chosen):
> - **KAL dual-auth** (read surface; writes stay internal-only): SERVICE mode (X-Internal-Token) OR USER mode —
>   validate the platform HS256 Bearer JWT (Node crypto, no dep; rejects alg=none/wrong-sig/expired, timing-safe) +
>   GRANT-CHECK the book against book-service (`/internal/books/{id}/access`) since the BFF is a dumb proxy. X-User-Id
>   PINNED from the JWT sub (anti-spoof). Fail-closed + 5s grant timeout + bounded positive-grant cache.
> - **BFF** `/v1/kal` → knowledge-gateway (dumb JWT passthrough, 503-on-down). KAL compose env: JWT_SECRET + BOOK_SERVICE_URL.
> - **Reviewed** (/review-impl: MED grant-timeout + LOW cache-bound fixed) + **live-smoked** the full FE path with a
>   REAL login JWT: owned-book→200, non-granted→403, no-auth/garbage→401, service-mode→200. KAL jest 17 green.
>
> **▶ ONLY REMAINING: X6c — the net-new FE TEMPORAL SURFACES (React, this branch):** canonical card (as-of folded
> canonical), time/version slider (scrub chapter ordinal), change timeline w/ citations, diff view (state between two
> ordinals), retrieval-not-scroll, per-episode translation (§7). Reads go through the BFF `/v1/kal/*` (now live).
>
> **▶ REMAINING = the consumer/FE FANOUT (parallel worktree agents, the locked strategy):**
> X1 composition→KAL (+fix `_cast_roster` cursor drain) · X2 lore-enrichment→KAL · X3 wiki→KAL (kill direct-EAV) ·
> X4 chat→KAL · X5 translation→KAL (as-of inject + immutable-once cache) · X6 FE temporal surfaces (canonical card,
> time slider, change timeline, diff, retrieval) + migrate FE reads to KAL · X7 flip BOTH INV-KAL lints (table-read +
> the new HTTP-surface lint) to ENFORCING. Each binds ONLY to the frozen `kal.v1.yaml` → provably disjoint, parallel-safe.

> **▶ Shipped this run (production-ready, all verified on real DB / build / tests):**
> - **F1d (producer)** `d5662b64` — facts FLOW from extraction: translation worker passes `chapter_ordinal`,
>   glossary writeback ingests the episode + opens append-only facts per written attr, idempotent. (`TestBulkExtract_EmitsTemporalFacts`)
> - **F4-live core** `c13d11bb` — glossary `/internal/facts/*`: GET facts/timeline/attr-values (bounded, as-of) + POST
>   episode/append/retract; KAL paths aligned. (`TestFactsHTTP`: append supersedes, retract restitches over the router)
> - **F4-writes** `41070247` — internal merge/resolve-entity/split routes + KAL wiring (resolve-or-create idempotent).
> - **in-story dates** `a5d0d80e` (merged) — `event_date_iso` additive valid-time on KG facts/relations (19 tests; chapter-ordinal stays primary).
> - **prod bugfix** `94caea91` — world-timeline `NameError: q` (pre-existing crash) fixed.
>
> **▶ Remaining foundation (then fanout):**
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** dirty queue + canonical_snapshot write + lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground
>   (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff. LLM via provider-registry (likely a worker/knowledge pass like #26/#7 summarize).
>   Makes `get_canonical` return the FOLDED canonical (today it serves canon-content). Adds the KAL `fold` route.
> - **F1g — bi-temporal names:** name as `fact_kind='name'` (single) + aliases as `'alias'` (multi); as-of-name; resolver
>   matches the across-time alias set. RECONCILE: migration 0048 converts the cold-start/F1d `attribute` name/aliases
>   facts → name/alias kind, and `refreshEAVProjection` + the D5 check must project name-kind facts to the name EAV.

> ([spec](../specs/2026-06-29-incremental-temporal-knowledge-architecture.md) §12/§12.7.8 govern;
> [plan](../plans/2026-06-30-temporal-knowledge-architecture-impl.md)). Append-only bi-temporal facts as the
> sole SSOT (INV-FACTS §12.0); everything else a rebuildable cache. Execution = **serial foundation → parallel
> fanout** (user-directed: build foundation serially, checkpoint, then fan out consumer migrations).
>
> **▶ Shipped this session — the SSOT substrate spine, all real-DB verified on `loreweave_glossary`:**
> - **F0** `fc4c9a80` — froze the **KAL v1 contract** (`contracts/api/knowledge-gateway/kal.v1.yaml`), the keystone
>   every consumer binds to; `knowledge-gateway: missing` row in `language-rule.yaml` (→ typescript at F4 scaffold).
> - **F1a** `ae6f17fd` — `0044` **entity_facts + episodes** bi-temporal SSOT schema (content-addressed natural key,
>   `valid_to_eff` INT64_MAX null-sink, `coverage_xid` xid8, merge_journal fact/episode-move cols). Idempotent 2×.
> - **F1b** `728efaf9` — `0045` **maintain_chain** the single `valid_to` writer (§12.3.3). Verified all 3 scenarios:
>   out-of-order backfill (A2), retract restitch (A3), oscillation (A4).
> - **F1c** `8a2b8e6d` — **fact core** Go (`facts.go`): appendFact (idempotent NK), retractFacts (restitch),
>   ingestEpisode, refreshEAVProjection (repair/cutover), per-(entity,attr) chain lock. `TestFactCore` PASSES (real DB).
> - **F1h** `8eb419f9` — `0046` **cold-start seed**: 22,056 facts seeded from live EAV; **projection==flat_eav 0 mismatches** (§12.5.4/D5).
> - **F2 schema** `fdf6c0d8` — `0047` **canonical versioned-cache** tables (canonical_snapshot + canonical_fold_state), §12.1.
>
> ⚠ Migrations **0044–0047 are applied to the running dev `loreweave_glossary`** (by F1c's `RunChain`); a fresh stack
> picks them up from the ledger on boot.
>
> **▶ PARALLEL track (background agent, worktree):** **F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify** in `knowledge-service`
> (Python/Neo4j) — substrate-independent from glossary. Ordinal valid-time unified with `from_order`, ordinal-aware
> close (A2 on the KG side), extraction-driven invalidate/retract, quote-on-citation, per-entity ordinal snapshot.
> **Merge its worktree branch at the integration node before F4.**
>
> **▶ F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify — MERGED `f2d5ca3e`** (was a parallel worktree agent); 24 F3 unit tests
> re-verified green post-merge. All under `services/knowledge-service/` (disjoint from glossary).
>
> **▶ F1f — fact-chain merge + split (DONE):** `ecc7e587` **merge** (§12.4.1, `mergeFactChains`/`revertFactChains`,
> journal `repointed_fact_ids`+`invalidated_fact_ids`, same-ordinal tiebreak, chain locks both sides) +
> `f52e50f7` **split** (§12.4.2, `splitFactsByEpisode` re-attribute-by-provenance, originals reason='split').
> `TestMergeFactChains`/`TestSplitFactsByEpisode` green; existing Merge/Revert/Dedup suites green (no regression).
>
> **▶ F4 — KAL gateway service + INV-KAL lint (DONE, structure):**
> - `2ab5f710` **KAL NestJS service** (`services/knowledge-gateway`) implementing `kal.v1.yaml`: config/main/health +
>   `KalReadController` (get_canonical/get_facts/timeline/list_attr_values/roster/search/neighborhood/retrieve, each with
>   per-substrate `temporal_capability`, KG `as_of` dropped when `temporal_unsupported`) + `KalWriteController`
>   (append/close/retract/merge/split/fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity forwarding to glossary `/internal/facts/*`).
>   **Verified: npm install + nest build clean; boots + serves /health + /health/ready (kgTemporal=ordinal_valid_time),
>   16 routes mapped.** `language-rule.yaml` `missing`→`typescript`; lint PASS.
> - `434894d8` **INV-KAL table-read lint** (`scripts/knowledge-access-gate.py`, wired into `.githooks/pre-commit`): no
>   consumer reads the glossary EAV / Neo4j directly. Full-scan PASS.
>
> **▶ NEXT — F4-FOLLOW-ON + remaining foundation, then fanout:**
> 1. **F4-follow-on (live writes):** add the glossary **`/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** (Go handlers wrapping the F1c/F1f
>    fact core — appendFact/retract/mergeFactChains/splitFactsByEpisode/fold) so the KAL write verbs hit a real target;
>    then a **cross-service live-smoke** (KAL → glossary fact route → DB) + verify the read endpoints' downstream path
>    mapping against the actual glossary/KG routes. (KAL reads/writes build + the service boots; full delegation is the
>    cross-service smoke, currently unverified end-to-end.)
> 2. **F2 app** — the fold handler: lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff
>    (needs a provider-registry LLM call). Enhances `get_canonical` behind the frozen contract.
> 3. **F1g** — bi-temporal name/aliases (§12.4.3) + as-of-name. **Value partly gated on F1d** (deferred writeback wiring);
>    reconciles `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`.
> 4. **CHECKPOINT** → then parallel **fanout** X1–X7 (consumer migrations onto the KAL, FE temporal surfaces).
>
> **▶ SCOPE (locked 2026-06-30): this branch is the PRODUCTION-READY refactor — NO deferrals.** Everything below is
> in-branch work to COMPLETE (the repo adopts the KAL immediately after merge, so nothing core may be stubbed/parked).
> Includes the full consumer + FE fanout (X1–X7) and both INV-KAL lints flipped to ENFORCING. The items that were
> "deferred" are now must-complete work:
> - **F1d — writeback Path-A emission (must complete):** wire fact emission into the glossary writeback; extend the
>   bulk-extract request with `chapter_ordinal` and update the translation-service extraction caller to pass it.
> - **F4-live — glossary `/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** wrapping the Go fact core (append/close/retract/merge/split/
>   fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity) so the KAL writes are real; cross-service KAL→glossary→DB live-smoke.
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff (LLM via provider-registry).
> - **F1g — bi-temporal name/aliases** (§12.4.3) + as-of-name + RECONCILE the cold-start name/aliases representation
>   (supersede the cold-start `attribute` name/alias facts → `name`/`alias` kind facts; the old `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`).
> - **In-story dates (must build — user pulled into v1):** detected in-story time (`event_date_iso`) as an additional KG
>   valid-time source (spec §9 dec-3). Knowledge-service.
> - **Fanout X1–X7 (in-branch):** migrate composition, chat, lore-enrichment, translation, wiki, FE to read/write through
>   the KAL; kill every direct EAV/KG read; flip BOTH INV-KAL lints (table-read + HTTP-surface) to ENFORCING.
>
> **▶ /review-impl (2026-06-30) — 7 findings, ALL FIXED (no HIGH):** MED-1 same-ordinal single-valued conflict → last-write-wins supersede + deterministic projection tiebreak (`TestFactSameOrdinalConflict`); MED-2 unenforced chain-lock → strengthened contract doc + `TestFactChainLockSerializes` (same-chain blocks, disjoint free); LOW-2 cold-start ordinal `0→-1` (chapter_index is 0-based); LOW-5 targeted `ON CONFLICT` on the natural-key expression index; LOW-3 `refreshEAVProjection` attr_def_id-coupling doc; LOW-4 `reconcileEpisode` F1d-obligation doc + now exercised; LOW-1 → `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE` above. All 3 facts tests green on real DB; cold-start re-verified `projection==flat_eav` 0 mismatches with the `-1` sentinel.

# ▶▶ (prior) **Motif book-collaboration tier (model B) + shared-graph links + MCP edit SHIPPED** · branch `feat/narrative-pattern-library` · HEAD `8c4c45c2`+ · 2026-06-29

> **▶ MERGE 2026-06-29:** `origin/main` merged into this branch (179 commits — the **public-MCP gateway + lazy tool-loading** track, critical-UX fixes, glossary/knowledge/campaign work). Conflicts resolved (composition `actions.py` confirm = JWT-identity ∪ public-MCP spend-attribution; engine `plan.py`/`stitch.py` signatures = both; studio panels = `canonview` ∪ `motifs`/`conformance`; gateway test `mcpPublicGatewayUrl`). The motif MCP tools are exposed to the public-MCP gateway: `find_tools` (lazy discovery) picks them up dynamically from the federation catalog, and they are classified in the edge `TOOL_POLICY` allowlist (commit `2aa65765`). Below is this branch's motif work; the merged-in main tracks + all prior history are archived (see the pointer at the bottom).

> **▶ Follow-up this session (2nd commit) — both model-B deferrals CLOSED:** `D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER` (shared-graph link editing — guard rewrite + repo/MCP book_id paths) and `D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED` (the `composition_motif_patch` MCP edit tool). Details in the "Deferred … BOTH NOW CLEARED" block below. 150 motif unit tests + 38 motif DB integration tests green; migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`; provider-gate clean.

> **▶ Shipped this session — the two NEW future-feature rows (now CLOSED):**
> - **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER` (model B) — a THIRD tenancy tier (the book SHARED library).** Spec: [docs/specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md](../specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md). A `motif.book_shared=true` row is owned by its creator (attribution) but VISIBLE to the book's VIEW-grantees and WRITABLE by its EDIT-grantees — access is the **book grant resolved at the caller**, never row ownership. User decisions (this session): **context-scoped reads** (per-book gate, no global "all my books"), **any-EDIT-grantee writes** (edit + archive), **adopt + create + mine** all produce shared rows. The base read predicate is **UNCHANGED** (a foreign shared row is fail-closed invisible to get_visible/list_for_caller/catalog/get_by_codes); shared rows surface ONLY through the gated book-context methods. Touch-points: schema (`book_shared` col + `motif_book_shared_shape` CHECK [shared ⇒ book+owner+private, the public-catalog-orthogonality guard] + per-book `uq_motif_book_shared` + re-narrowed `uq_motif_user_book WHERE …AND NOT book_shared`); repo (`clone/adopt/create/_clone_with_code` thread book_shared; new `list_in_book/get_in_book/patch_shared/archive_shared`; adopt locks per-BOOK + dedups per-(book,code) for the shared tier); MCP (`adopt target=book_shared`, `create target=book_shared`, `mine promote_target=book_shared`, `archive book_id=`, new `composition_motif_book_list`); confirm dispatch (`book_shared` rides the payload, re-gated EDIT); FE (3rd adopt target "Share with collaborators" + `Shared` badge).
> - **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK` — HTTP parity.** `POST /motifs/{id}/adopt` now takes `target=user|book|book_shared`+`book_id`, **EDIT-gated before the clone** (no softer than MCP); `GET /motifs/book/{id}` (VIEW-gated list); `PATCH`/`DELETE …?book_id=` (EDIT-gated shared edit/archive, visibility-flip refused 400). A book-shared pattern root does NOT auto-adopt its members (the half-shared-pattern guard).
>
> **VERIFY:** 90 motif unit tests + new repo/mcp/router cases green; **integration (real PG)**: new `test_motif_book_shared_db.py` (shape CHECK, per-book dedup, list/get scoping, any-grantee patch/archive) + 32 existing motif DB tests pass on a throwaway DB; **migration live-smoked idempotent on the REAL existing model-A `loreweave_composition`** (added book_shared col + CHECK + uq_motif_book_shared + re-narrowed uq_motif_user_book; two runs, no error). FE 152 motif tests + tsc + provider-gate clean. **`/review-impl` adversarial tenancy review: 0 HIGH / 0 MED** — all 9 read/write/leak/confirm/dedup checks PASS with file:line evidence; 3 LOW/COSMETIC notes (deferred below).
>
> **▶ Deferred (from the model-B review — BOTH NOW CLEARED 2026-06-29):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER`** — **CLEARED:** the `motif_link_guard` was rewritten (NULL-safe) to a precise 3-arm same-tier rule — both SYSTEM, or both the SAME book's SHARED tier (owners may differ — the point of a collaborator graph), or both the SAME user's PRIVATE tier. A shared↔private/system/cross-book link is rejected at the DB. Repo `list_links/create_link/delete_link` gained a `book_id` path (anchor via get_in_book; both endpoints must be `book_shared AND book_id`); MCP link tools take `book_id` (VIEW for list, EDIT for create/delete). Live-PG tested (same-book allowed, 3 cross-tier rejections, 3rd-grantee list/delete) + migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`. **Caught+fixed a SQL three-valued-logic bug**: `owner = owner` with a NULL operand yields NULL so `IF NOT NULL` wouldn't fire (a user→system link would have slipped) — every arm is now NULL-guarded.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED`** — **CLEARED:** new `composition_motif_patch` MCP tool (Tier-A) — owner-keyed by default, or a SHARED-tier edit with `book_id` (EDIT-gated → patch_shared). Optimistic-lock `expected_version` (stale → applied_conflict), visibility/publish deliberately NOT editable (separate flow), honest undo that patches changed fields back to prior values. Owner path denies a foreign row before any write; shared path confirms the row is shared-in-this-book.

> # ▶▶ (prior) **Motif library COMPLETE — audit 7/7 closed (WI-1…WI-6)** · HEAD `04bab448`+ · 2026-06-29

> **What this branch is:** the narrative-pattern (motif/arc) library — Tier-W cost-gated MCP flows for mining, conformance, adopt, and 3-way publish-sync, fronted by the FE→MCP-tool bridge. The feature body landed across prior sessions; this session closed the **completeness-audit tail** AND shipped **WI-5 per-book adopt**.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (all green — 1083+ backend unit + 151 FE motif tests, tsc + provider-gate clean):**
> - **Audit tail (committed `f1157b25`…`b8f0ddb3`):** BYOK model_ref threading through `motif_mine`/`arc_import`; the **tag-beats LLM extractor** (knowledge `POST /internal/extraction/tag-beats` → composition mine pre-pass; cross-tenant injection neutralized); **WI-3 arc semantic retrieve** (`composition_arc_suggest`); **WI-1/WI-2/WI-4 FE** (mine panel, full editor, publish-sync); `/review-impl` fixes (arc back-fill scoped to own/system; editor edit-loss). Completeness audit: [`docs/reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md`](../reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md).
> - **WI-5 per-book adopt (`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-PER-BOOK`) — model A "book-scoped filter" (user-chosen, NOT the tier-reversal):** `motif.book_id` is a per-book LABEL on a clone the adopter still owns. The read predicate + 2-tier tenancy are **UNCHANGED** (book_id only narrows the owner's view, never widens visibility). Design: [`docs/plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md`](../plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md). Touch-points: schema (`book_id` col + `uq_motif_user` scoped to `book_id IS NULL` + new `uq_motif_user_book` partial + `idx_motif_book`); `MotifRepo.clone/adopt/_clone_with_code/list_for_caller`; `_MotifAdoptArgs.target=Literal['user','book']`+`book_id` (EDIT-gated at propose **and** confirm); FE adopt-to-book toggle (api/hook/AdoptTargetModal/MotifLibraryView). **Live-smoked** on real `loreweave_composition`: migration idempotent; global+per-book coexist; same-book dup blocked by `uq_motif_user_book`; 0 leaked rows.
> - **WI-6 motif_link edge-walk (`D-MOTIF-LINK-EDGEWALK`) — the FINAL §5 gap, closing the audit 7/7:** 3 MCP tools — `composition_motif_link_list` (R, traverse out/in/both with neighbor code+name), `composition_motif_link_create` + `_delete` (A). User-scoped; WRITE requires **BOTH endpoints owned by the caller** (the system↔system hole the DB `motif_link_guard` same-tier check misses — a user may never reshape the shared graph). `MotifRepo.list_links/create_link/delete_link`. **Live-smoked**: own→own create/list/delete OK; own→system rejected by the guard; 0 leaked rows. The completeness audit is now **7/7 closed, nothing deferred**.
>
> **⚠ Two already-built misfires earlier this session** (memory [[verify-built-before-building]]): `D-W8-MOTIF-BEAT-EXTRACTOR` and `D-MOTIF-SYNC-3WAY-BASE` backend were **already shipped** — I rebuilt a duplicate sync router and reverted it (`a24d99ea`). **Before building ANY "missing"/deferred motif item: `git grep` the route/module/test first.**
>
> **▶ NEXT:** **PR `feat/narrative-pattern-library` → main** — the feature body + audit tail + WI-5 are complete, green, and live-smoked. (Note: the WI-5 migration was applied to the *running* dev `loreweave_composition` by the live-smoke; a fresh stack picks it up from `migrate.py` on boot.)
>
> **▶ Deferred (motif — the §5 audit tail is 7/7 CLOSED; these were NEW future-feature rows):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** model B shipped (see the top block). The shared book tier landed with a 0-HIGH/0-MED adversarial tenancy review.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** the HTTP adopt route exposes `target`+`book_id`, EDIT-gated (see the top block).
