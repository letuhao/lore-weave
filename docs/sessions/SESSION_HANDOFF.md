# ▶▶ NEXT SESSION STARTS HERE — **Temporal Knowledge — COMPLETE (foundation + close_fact + full fanout X1–X7 + FE temporal surfaces); branch ready for review/merge** · branch `feat/temporal-knowledge-architecture` · HEAD `cb7de1f0` · 2026-06-30

> **▶▶ ENTIRE EFFORT COMPLETE — the Incremental Temporal Knowledge Architecture is built, verified, and
> committed end-to-end (F0–F4 foundation + close_fact + X1–X7 fanout + X6 FE). The branch is production-ready
> for review/merge.**
> - **Foundation** (bi-temporal `entity_facts` SSOT, `maintain_chain` single writer, episodes, fold loop, KG
>   ordinal valid-time, KAL service) — hardened across **4 /review-impl passes** (4 HIGH + 6 MED + LOWs fixed, e2e green).
> - **close_fact** — pinned valid-time close (0049 pin-aware maintain_chain); reviewed + live-smoked.
> - **Fanout:** X1 composition / X2 lore-enrichment / X5 translation → KAL (consumers read bi-temporal knowledge
>   through the KAL); X3 wiki / X4 chat verified no-ops; **X7 — BOTH INV-KAL lints ENFORCED** (table-read +
>   HTTP-surface); cross-service smoke green.
> - **X6 FE:** KAL **dual-auth** (JWT + book grant-check, anti-spoof) + BFF `/v1/kal` route (reviewed + live-verified
>   200/403/401); **6 temporal surfaces** (canonical card, time slider, change timeline, diff, retrieval,
>   per-episode translation) — 45 tests, tsc clean, real-KAL shapes validated, mounted in the entity panel's
>   "Temporal" tab.
> - **Honest limitations (not bugs, future enhancements):** the per-episode-translation surface degrades to the
>   as-of canonical (no translation READ endpoint exists yet — a new feature, not this refactor); KG `as_of`
>   honored (F3 landed). A full browser/Playwright smoke of the Temporal tab is the one remaining nice-to-have
>   (shapes + the FE→BFF→KAL path + 45 component tests are verified).



> **▶ FOUNDATION COMPLETE — all verified (real DB / build / tests):** F0 KAL contract · F1a-h substrate
> (entity_facts/maintain_chain/episodes/cold-start) · F1d producer (facts flow from extraction, idempotent) ·
> F1f fact-chain merge + split · F1g bi-temporal name/aliases + as-of-name (0048 reconcile) · F2 canonical
> versioned-cache + the **fold loop** (glossary dirty/fetch/snapshot/degrade + the translation fold worker, LLM via
> provider-registry) · F3 KG ordinal valid-time + in-story dates · F4 KAL NestJS service (auth-guarded) with the full
> read surface (facts/timeline/attr-values/roster/canonical) + write surface (episode/append/close/retract/merge/
> resolve/split/fold) + the INV-KAL table-read lint (pre-commit). Three /review-impl passes, all HIGH/MED fixed
> (security: KAL inbound auth; tenancy: fact book-scoping; correctness: same-ordinal supersede, merge attr-set).
>
> **▶ PRE-FANOUT HARDENING REVIEW (this run) — 5 parallel adversarial reviewers over the whole foundation; 4 HIGH +
> 6 MED + LOWs found and ALL FIXED (15 files, 4 services), cross-service e2e GREEN on the rebuilt glossary image:**
> - HIGH: split cross-book leak (`internalSplitEntity` had no `entityInBook(source)` guard) · KG same-ordinal
>   `[base,base)` empty-interval data loss (4 cypher blocks → strictly-greater, mirrors PG core) · KAL `fold` write
>   unroutable → built the `internalTriggerFold` glossary backing + route (live-smoked HTTP 200) · KAL `facts/close`
>   doubled path. · MED: fold fingerprint lexical-vs-numeric max **livelock** (now numeric, live fingerprint `1638578`) ·
>   NULL-unsafe staleness probe · degrade-read book-scope + `refreshEAVProjection` hardcoded `'zh'` · 0048 re-run cold-start
>   scope · KAL downstream abort-signal + non-JSON-2xx guard + strict array coercion + NaN guard. · LOWs: fold worker
>   model_ref skip / cancelled≠backoff / prompt-injection delimiting. (The summary's `_cast_roster` drain bug = phantom.)
> - Verify: Go build/vet + 12 temporal Go tests (real DB) · jest 5/5 · fold pytest 3/3 · KG 15/15. E2E: KAL→glossary
>   forwards incl. the new fold write route + 401 auth guard, as-of reads, degrade-to-canon — all green.
> - **close_fact — DONE** `1e80637e` (PO: build-now): the frozen KAL close verb is now backed. Migration 0049 adds
>   `valid_to_pinned` + a pin-aware maintain_chain (CREATE OR REPLACE) — a manual close is an authored INPUT the single
>   deriver RESPECTS, never a competing deriver (the LOCKED §12.3.3 invariant holds). closeFact core + internalCloseFact
>   (book-scoped, validates in-book + valid_to > valid_from). Live-smoked: as-of 30 present, as-of 60 absent, 422/404 guards.
> - **/review-impl on close_fact — DONE** `fb3a34ed` (PO: commit-then-review): 3 MED found + fixed — overlap guard
>   (close past a successor → 422, was a double-value hole), split now PRESERVES the pin (`valid_to_ordinal`+`valid_to_pinned`
>   copied), and TestFactsHTTP regression-locks close half-open + overlap-422 + cross-book-404.
>
> **▶ FOUNDATION FULLY HARDENED + COMPLETE (incl. close_fact).**
>
> **▶ BACKEND FANOUT COMPLETE (X1–X5, X7) — consumers now read bi-temporal knowledge through the KAL; both
> INV-KAL lints ENFORCED:**
> - **X1 composition** `ae4016ea` — `KalClient.roster` DRAINS `next_cursor` (fixes the D4 truncation-at-100 bug);
>   `_cast_roster` migrated; dead `list_entities` removed. 1181 tests green.
> - **X2 lore-enrichment** `9af1c255` — `KalClient` (roster drain + facts/canonical/search); full-book cast from
>   the drained roster. Residual: `kind`/`short_description` supplemented from the authored entity-list (catalog,
>   not bi-temporal — out of INV-KAL scope, like the table-read gate's `glossary_entities` exemption).
> - **X5 translation** `0471b48c` — `KalClient` (get_facts/get_canonical) with **as-of-N inject** (threads
>   `chapter_sort_order`) + **immutable-once cache** (keyed on chapter content-hash + as-of). Default (no
>   `KNOWLEDGE_GATEWAY_URL`) byte-identical to today.
> - **X3 wiki / X4 chat — verified NO-OPs:** wiki is owner-side (glossary, lint-exempt); chat's entity reads are
>   MCP tools federated by name through ai-gateway (MCP-first invariant — must stay that way). No dead code added.
> - **X7** `7fb6e692` — built the INV-KAL **HTTP-surface lint** (was DEFERRED `D-KAL-HTTP-SURFACE-LINT`); BOTH
>   halves now ENFORCED in pre-commit. Both lints PASS full-scan (zero direct bi-temporal knowledge reads in consumers).
> - **KAL in docker-compose** `b695ab7d` — built + healthy in-stack; cross-service smoke: composition container →
>   `knowledge-gateway:3000` roster returns the contract shape.
>
> **▶ X6a/b — FE→KAL bridge DONE + live-verified** `bf772913` (PO: dual-auth chosen):
> - **KAL dual-auth** (read surface; writes stay internal-only): SERVICE mode (X-Internal-Token) OR USER mode —
>   validate the platform HS256 Bearer JWT (Node crypto, no dep; rejects alg=none/wrong-sig/expired, timing-safe) +
>   GRANT-CHECK the book against book-service (`/internal/books/{id}/access`) since the BFF is a dumb proxy. X-User-Id
>   PINNED from the JWT sub (anti-spoof). Fail-closed + 5s grant timeout + bounded positive-grant cache.
> - **BFF** `/v1/kal` → knowledge-gateway (dumb JWT passthrough, 503-on-down). KAL compose env: JWT_SECRET + BOOK_SERVICE_URL.
> - **Reviewed** (/review-impl: MED grant-timeout + LOW cache-bound fixed) + **live-smoked** the full FE path with a
>   REAL login JWT: owned-book→200, non-granted→403, no-auth/garbage→401, service-mode→200. KAL jest 17 green.
>
> **▶ ONLY REMAINING: X6c — the net-new FE TEMPORAL SURFACES (React, this branch):** canonical card (as-of folded
> canonical), time/version slider (scrub chapter ordinal), change timeline w/ citations, diff view (state between two
> ordinals), retrieval-not-scroll, per-episode translation (§7). Reads go through the BFF `/v1/kal/*` (now live).
>
> **▶ REMAINING = the consumer/FE FANOUT (parallel worktree agents, the locked strategy):**
> X1 composition→KAL (+fix `_cast_roster` cursor drain) · X2 lore-enrichment→KAL · X3 wiki→KAL (kill direct-EAV) ·
> X4 chat→KAL · X5 translation→KAL (as-of inject + immutable-once cache) · X6 FE temporal surfaces (canonical card,
> time slider, change timeline, diff, retrieval) + migrate FE reads to KAL · X7 flip BOTH INV-KAL lints (table-read +
> the new HTTP-surface lint) to ENFORCING. Each binds ONLY to the frozen `kal.v1.yaml` → provably disjoint, parallel-safe.

> **▶ Shipped this run (production-ready, all verified on real DB / build / tests):**
> - **F1d (producer)** `d5662b64` — facts FLOW from extraction: translation worker passes `chapter_ordinal`,
>   glossary writeback ingests the episode + opens append-only facts per written attr, idempotent. (`TestBulkExtract_EmitsTemporalFacts`)
> - **F4-live core** `c13d11bb` — glossary `/internal/facts/*`: GET facts/timeline/attr-values (bounded, as-of) + POST
>   episode/append/retract; KAL paths aligned. (`TestFactsHTTP`: append supersedes, retract restitches over the router)
> - **F4-writes** `41070247` — internal merge/resolve-entity/split routes + KAL wiring (resolve-or-create idempotent).
> - **in-story dates** `a5d0d80e` (merged) — `event_date_iso` additive valid-time on KG facts/relations (19 tests; chapter-ordinal stays primary).
> - **prod bugfix** `94caea91` — world-timeline `NameError: q` (pre-existing crash) fixed.
>
> **▶ Remaining foundation (then fanout):**
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** dirty queue + canonical_snapshot write + lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground
>   (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff. LLM via provider-registry (likely a worker/knowledge pass like #26/#7 summarize).
>   Makes `get_canonical` return the FOLDED canonical (today it serves canon-content). Adds the KAL `fold` route.
> - **F1g — bi-temporal names:** name as `fact_kind='name'` (single) + aliases as `'alias'` (multi); as-of-name; resolver
>   matches the across-time alias set. RECONCILE: migration 0048 converts the cold-start/F1d `attribute` name/aliases
>   facts → name/alias kind, and `refreshEAVProjection` + the D5 check must project name-kind facts to the name EAV.
> - then **fanout X1–X7** (parallel worktree agents per the locked strategy).


> **What this branch is:** implementing the Incremental Temporal Knowledge Architecture
> ([spec](../specs/2026-06-29-incremental-temporal-knowledge-architecture.md) §12/§12.7.8 govern;
> [plan](../plans/2026-06-30-temporal-knowledge-architecture-impl.md)). Append-only bi-temporal facts as the
> sole SSOT (INV-FACTS §12.0); everything else a rebuildable cache. Execution = **serial foundation → parallel
> fanout** (user-directed: build foundation serially, checkpoint, then fan out consumer migrations).
>
> **▶ Shipped this session — the SSOT substrate spine, all real-DB verified on `loreweave_glossary`:**
> - **F0** `fc4c9a80` — froze the **KAL v1 contract** (`contracts/api/knowledge-gateway/kal.v1.yaml`), the keystone
>   every consumer binds to; `knowledge-gateway: missing` row in `language-rule.yaml` (→ typescript at F4 scaffold).
> - **F1a** `ae6f17fd` — `0044` **entity_facts + episodes** bi-temporal SSOT schema (content-addressed natural key,
>   `valid_to_eff` INT64_MAX null-sink, `coverage_xid` xid8, merge_journal fact/episode-move cols). Idempotent 2×.
> - **F1b** `728efaf9` — `0045` **maintain_chain** the single `valid_to` writer (§12.3.3). Verified all 3 scenarios:
>   out-of-order backfill (A2), retract restitch (A3), oscillation (A4).
> - **F1c** `8a2b8e6d` — **fact core** Go (`facts.go`): appendFact (idempotent NK), retractFacts (restitch),
>   ingestEpisode, refreshEAVProjection (repair/cutover), per-(entity,attr) chain lock. `TestFactCore` PASSES (real DB).
> - **F1h** `8eb419f9` — `0046` **cold-start seed**: 22,056 facts seeded from live EAV; **projection==flat_eav 0 mismatches** (§12.5.4/D5).
> - **F2 schema** `fdf6c0d8` — `0047` **canonical versioned-cache** tables (canonical_snapshot + canonical_fold_state), §12.1.
>
> ⚠ Migrations **0044–0047 are applied to the running dev `loreweave_glossary`** (by F1c's `RunChain`); a fresh stack
> picks them up from the ledger on boot.
>
> **▶ PARALLEL track (background agent, worktree):** **F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify** in `knowledge-service`
> (Python/Neo4j) — substrate-independent from glossary. Ordinal valid-time unified with `from_order`, ordinal-aware
> close (A2 on the KG side), extraction-driven invalidate/retract, quote-on-citation, per-entity ordinal snapshot.
> **Merge its worktree branch at the integration node before F4.**
>
> **▶ F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify — MERGED `f2d5ca3e`** (was a parallel worktree agent); 24 F3 unit tests
> re-verified green post-merge. All under `services/knowledge-service/` (disjoint from glossary).
>
> **▶ F1f — fact-chain merge + split (DONE):** `ecc7e587` **merge** (§12.4.1, `mergeFactChains`/`revertFactChains`,
> journal `repointed_fact_ids`+`invalidated_fact_ids`, same-ordinal tiebreak, chain locks both sides) +
> `f52e50f7` **split** (§12.4.2, `splitFactsByEpisode` re-attribute-by-provenance, originals reason='split').
> `TestMergeFactChains`/`TestSplitFactsByEpisode` green; existing Merge/Revert/Dedup suites green (no regression).
>
> **▶ F4 — KAL gateway service + INV-KAL lint (DONE, structure):**
> - `2ab5f710` **KAL NestJS service** (`services/knowledge-gateway`) implementing `kal.v1.yaml`: config/main/health +
>   `KalReadController` (get_canonical/get_facts/timeline/list_attr_values/roster/search/neighborhood/retrieve, each with
>   per-substrate `temporal_capability`, KG `as_of` dropped when `temporal_unsupported`) + `KalWriteController`
>   (append/close/retract/merge/split/fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity forwarding to glossary `/internal/facts/*`).
>   **Verified: npm install + nest build clean; boots + serves /health + /health/ready (kgTemporal=ordinal_valid_time),
>   16 routes mapped.** `language-rule.yaml` `missing`→`typescript`; lint PASS.
> - `434894d8` **INV-KAL table-read lint** (`scripts/knowledge-access-gate.py`, wired into `.githooks/pre-commit`): no
>   consumer reads the glossary EAV / Neo4j directly. Full-scan PASS.
>
> **▶ NEXT — F4-FOLLOW-ON + remaining foundation, then fanout:**
> 1. **F4-follow-on (live writes):** add the glossary **`/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** (Go handlers wrapping the F1c/F1f
>    fact core — appendFact/retract/mergeFactChains/splitFactsByEpisode/fold) so the KAL write verbs hit a real target;
>    then a **cross-service live-smoke** (KAL → glossary fact route → DB) + verify the read endpoints' downstream path
>    mapping against the actual glossary/KG routes. (KAL reads/writes build + the service boots; full delegation is the
>    cross-service smoke, currently unverified end-to-end.)
> 2. **F2 app** — the fold handler: lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff
>    (needs a provider-registry LLM call). Enhances `get_canonical` behind the frozen contract.
> 3. **F1g** — bi-temporal name/aliases (§12.4.3) + as-of-name. **Value partly gated on F1d** (deferred writeback wiring);
>    reconciles `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`.
> 4. **CHECKPOINT** → then parallel **fanout** X1–X7 (consumer migrations onto the KAL, FE temporal surfaces).
>
> **▶ SCOPE (locked 2026-06-30): this branch is the PRODUCTION-READY refactor — NO deferrals.** Everything below is
> in-branch work to COMPLETE (the repo adopts the KAL immediately after merge, so nothing core may be stubbed/parked).
> Includes the full consumer + FE fanout (X1–X7) and both INV-KAL lints flipped to ENFORCING. The items that were
> "deferred" are now must-complete work:
> - **F1d — writeback Path-A emission (must complete):** wire fact emission into the glossary writeback; extend the
>   bulk-extract request with `chapter_ordinal` and update the translation-service extraction caller to pass it.
> - **F4-live — glossary `/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** wrapping the Go fact core (append/close/retract/merge/split/
>   fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity) so the KAL writes are real; cross-service KAL→glossary→DB live-smoke.
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff (LLM via provider-registry).
> - **F1g — bi-temporal name/aliases** (§12.4.3) + as-of-name + RECONCILE the cold-start name/aliases representation
>   (supersede the cold-start `attribute` name/alias facts → `name`/`alias` kind facts; the old `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`).
> - **In-story dates (must build — user pulled into v1):** detected in-story time (`event_date_iso`) as an additional KG
>   valid-time source (spec §9 dec-3). Knowledge-service.
> - **Fanout X1–X7 (in-branch):** migrate composition, chat, lore-enrichment, translation, wiki, FE to read/write through
>   the KAL; kill every direct EAV/KG read; flip BOTH INV-KAL lints (table-read + HTTP-surface) to ENFORCING.
>
> **▶ /review-impl (2026-06-30) — 7 findings, ALL FIXED (no HIGH):** MED-1 same-ordinal single-valued conflict → last-write-wins supersede + deterministic projection tiebreak (`TestFactSameOrdinalConflict`); MED-2 unenforced chain-lock → strengthened contract doc + `TestFactChainLockSerializes` (same-chain blocks, disjoint free); LOW-2 cold-start ordinal `0→-1` (chapter_index is 0-based); LOW-5 targeted `ON CONFLICT` on the natural-key expression index; LOW-3 `refreshEAVProjection` attr_def_id-coupling doc; LOW-4 `reconcileEpisode` F1d-obligation doc + now exercised; LOW-1 → `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE` above. All 3 facts tests green on real DB; cold-start re-verified `projection==flat_eav` 0 mismatches with the `-1` sentinel.

# ▶▶ (prior) **Motif book-collaboration tier (model B) + shared-graph links + MCP edit SHIPPED** · branch `feat/narrative-pattern-library` · HEAD `8c4c45c2`+ · 2026-06-29

> **▶ MERGE 2026-06-29:** `origin/main` merged into this branch (179 commits — the **public-MCP gateway + lazy tool-loading** track, critical-UX fixes, glossary/knowledge/campaign work). Conflicts resolved (composition `actions.py` confirm = JWT-identity ∪ public-MCP spend-attribution; engine `plan.py`/`stitch.py` signatures = both; studio panels = `canonview` ∪ `motifs`/`conformance`; gateway test `mcpPublicGatewayUrl`). The motif MCP tools are exposed to the public-MCP gateway: `find_tools` (lazy discovery) picks them up dynamically from the federation catalog, and they are classified in the edge `TOOL_POLICY` allowlist (commit `2aa65765`). Below is this branch's motif work; the merged-in main tracks + all prior history are archived (see the pointer at the bottom).

> **▶ Follow-up this session (2nd commit) — both model-B deferrals CLOSED:** `D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER` (shared-graph link editing — guard rewrite + repo/MCP book_id paths) and `D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED` (the `composition_motif_patch` MCP edit tool). Details in the "Deferred … BOTH NOW CLEARED" block below. 150 motif unit tests + 38 motif DB integration tests green; migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`; provider-gate clean.

> **▶ Shipped this session — the two NEW future-feature rows (now CLOSED):**
> - **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER` (model B) — a THIRD tenancy tier (the book SHARED library).** Spec: [docs/specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md](../specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md). A `motif.book_shared=true` row is owned by its creator (attribution) but VISIBLE to the book's VIEW-grantees and WRITABLE by its EDIT-grantees — access is the **book grant resolved at the caller**, never row ownership. User decisions (this session): **context-scoped reads** (per-book gate, no global "all my books"), **any-EDIT-grantee writes** (edit + archive), **adopt + create + mine** all produce shared rows. The base read predicate is **UNCHANGED** (a foreign shared row is fail-closed invisible to get_visible/list_for_caller/catalog/get_by_codes); shared rows surface ONLY through the gated book-context methods. Touch-points: schema (`book_shared` col + `motif_book_shared_shape` CHECK [shared ⇒ book+owner+private, the public-catalog-orthogonality guard] + per-book `uq_motif_book_shared` + re-narrowed `uq_motif_user_book WHERE …AND NOT book_shared`); repo (`clone/adopt/create/_clone_with_code` thread book_shared; new `list_in_book/get_in_book/patch_shared/archive_shared`; adopt locks per-BOOK + dedups per-(book,code) for the shared tier); MCP (`adopt target=book_shared`, `create target=book_shared`, `mine promote_target=book_shared`, `archive book_id=`, new `composition_motif_book_list`); confirm dispatch (`book_shared` rides the payload, re-gated EDIT); FE (3rd adopt target "Share with collaborators" + `Shared` badge).
> - **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK` — HTTP parity.** `POST /motifs/{id}/adopt` now takes `target=user|book|book_shared`+`book_id`, **EDIT-gated before the clone** (no softer than MCP); `GET /motifs/book/{id}` (VIEW-gated list); `PATCH`/`DELETE …?book_id=` (EDIT-gated shared edit/archive, visibility-flip refused 400). A book-shared pattern root does NOT auto-adopt its members (the half-shared-pattern guard).
>
> **VERIFY:** 90 motif unit tests + new repo/mcp/router cases green; **integration (real PG)**: new `test_motif_book_shared_db.py` (shape CHECK, per-book dedup, list/get scoping, any-grantee patch/archive) + 32 existing motif DB tests pass on a throwaway DB; **migration live-smoked idempotent on the REAL existing model-A `loreweave_composition`** (added book_shared col + CHECK + uq_motif_book_shared + re-narrowed uq_motif_user_book; two runs, no error). FE 152 motif tests + tsc + provider-gate clean. **`/review-impl` adversarial tenancy review: 0 HIGH / 0 MED** — all 9 read/write/leak/confirm/dedup checks PASS with file:line evidence; 3 LOW/COSMETIC notes (deferred below).
>
> **▶ Deferred (from the model-B review — BOTH NOW CLEARED 2026-06-29):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER`** — **CLEARED:** the `motif_link_guard` was rewritten (NULL-safe) to a precise 3-arm same-tier rule — both SYSTEM, or both the SAME book's SHARED tier (owners may differ — the point of a collaborator graph), or both the SAME user's PRIVATE tier. A shared↔private/system/cross-book link is rejected at the DB. Repo `list_links/create_link/delete_link` gained a `book_id` path (anchor via get_in_book; both endpoints must be `book_shared AND book_id`); MCP link tools take `book_id` (VIEW for list, EDIT for create/delete). Live-PG tested (same-book allowed, 3 cross-tier rejections, 3rd-grantee list/delete) + migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`. **Caught+fixed a SQL three-valued-logic bug**: `owner = owner` with a NULL operand yields NULL so `IF NOT NULL` wouldn't fire (a user→system link would have slipped) — every arm is now NULL-guarded.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED`** — **CLEARED:** new `composition_motif_patch` MCP tool (Tier-A) — owner-keyed by default, or a SHARED-tier edit with `book_id` (EDIT-gated → patch_shared). Optimistic-lock `expected_version` (stale → applied_conflict), visibility/publish deliberately NOT editable (separate flow), honest undo that patches changed fields back to prior values. Owner path denies a foreign row before any write; shared path confirms the row is shared-in-this-book.

> # ▶▶ (prior) **Motif library COMPLETE — audit 7/7 closed (WI-1…WI-6)** · HEAD `04bab448`+ · 2026-06-29

> **What this branch is:** the narrative-pattern (motif/arc) library — Tier-W cost-gated MCP flows for mining, conformance, adopt, and 3-way publish-sync, fronted by the FE→MCP-tool bridge. The feature body landed across prior sessions; this session closed the **completeness-audit tail** AND shipped **WI-5 per-book adopt**.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (all green — 1083+ backend unit + 151 FE motif tests, tsc + provider-gate clean):**
> - **Audit tail (committed `f1157b25`…`b8f0ddb3`):** BYOK model_ref threading through `motif_mine`/`arc_import`; the **tag-beats LLM extractor** (knowledge `POST /internal/extraction/tag-beats` → composition mine pre-pass; cross-tenant injection neutralized); **WI-3 arc semantic retrieve** (`composition_arc_suggest`); **WI-1/WI-2/WI-4 FE** (mine panel, full editor, publish-sync); `/review-impl` fixes (arc back-fill scoped to own/system; editor edit-loss). Completeness audit: [`docs/reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md`](../reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md).
> - **WI-5 per-book adopt (`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-PER-BOOK`) — model A "book-scoped filter" (user-chosen, NOT the tier-reversal):** `motif.book_id` is a per-book LABEL on a clone the adopter still owns. The read predicate + 2-tier tenancy are **UNCHANGED** (book_id only narrows the owner's view, never widens visibility). Design: [`docs/plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md`](../plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md). Touch-points: schema (`book_id` col + `uq_motif_user` scoped to `book_id IS NULL` + new `uq_motif_user_book` partial + `idx_motif_book`); `MotifRepo.clone/adopt/_clone_with_code/list_for_caller`; `_MotifAdoptArgs.target=Literal['user','book']`+`book_id` (EDIT-gated at propose **and** confirm); FE adopt-to-book toggle (api/hook/AdoptTargetModal/MotifLibraryView). **Live-smoked** on real `loreweave_composition`: migration idempotent; global+per-book coexist; same-book dup blocked by `uq_motif_user_book`; 0 leaked rows.
> - **WI-6 motif_link edge-walk (`D-MOTIF-LINK-EDGEWALK`) — the FINAL §5 gap, closing the audit 7/7:** 3 MCP tools — `composition_motif_link_list` (R, traverse out/in/both with neighbor code+name), `composition_motif_link_create` + `_delete` (A). User-scoped; WRITE requires **BOTH endpoints owned by the caller** (the system↔system hole the DB `motif_link_guard` same-tier check misses — a user may never reshape the shared graph). `MotifRepo.list_links/create_link/delete_link`. **Live-smoked**: own→own create/list/delete OK; own→system rejected by the guard; 0 leaked rows. The completeness audit is now **7/7 closed, nothing deferred**.
>
> **⚠ Two already-built misfires earlier this session** (memory [[verify-built-before-building]]): `D-W8-MOTIF-BEAT-EXTRACTOR` and `D-MOTIF-SYNC-3WAY-BASE` backend were **already shipped** — I rebuilt a duplicate sync router and reverted it (`a24d99ea`). **Before building ANY "missing"/deferred motif item: `git grep` the route/module/test first.**
>
> **▶ NEXT:** **PR `feat/narrative-pattern-library` → main** — the feature body + audit tail + WI-5 are complete, green, and live-smoked. (Note: the WI-5 migration was applied to the *running* dev `loreweave_composition` by the live-smoke; a fresh stack picks it up from `migrate.py` on boot.)
>
> **▶ Deferred (motif — the §5 audit tail is 7/7 CLOSED; these were NEW future-feature rows):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** model B shipped (see the top block). The shared book tier landed with a 0-HIGH/0-MED adversarial tenancy review.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** the HTTP adopt route exposes `target`+`book_id`, EDIT-gated (see the top block).

> **▶ Archived 2026-06-30** — older / other-track handoffs moved to [`SESSION_ARCHIVE.md`](SESSION_ARCHIVE.md) to keep this file to the **active branch** only. The 2026-06-29 merge pulled in main's `Critical UX` + `Public MCP` tracks and all prior session history (glossary / composition / roleplay / extraction / KG / campaign / Sessions 66–71); all of it (incl. each track's open-defer register) lives in the archive and on its own branch + `main`. Search `SESSION_ARCHIVE.md` for a `D-…` id if you need a prior-track defer.
