> **▶ CHAT QUALITY WAVE — W0 + W1 SHIPPED + LIVE-SMOKED 2026-07-03 (parallel sub-agent build, disjoint files,

> failure audit: 26-30% hard-error rate). **W0 MCP reliability:** base_version hallucination-trap killed (409 embeds
> current version; implausible timestamp = not-read shim — top bucket, 22% of errors), real JSON-schema enums at 22

> **▶ #12 CYCLE-1c — F4 SCENEMARKER-EMIT + J1 MULTI-INSTANCE JSON EDITOR — SHIPPED + LIVE-SMOKED 2026-07-03.**
> `D-SCENEMARKER-EMIT` CLEARED (RAID quiet window opened): a generated chapter now lands **pre-anchored** — no ⚓
> needed. Root finding: composition's `prose_doc.text_to_tiptap_doc` mirrored only tiptap.go's *plain* variant; the
> *markdown* heading variant was never mirrored, so the server persist path flattened `###` lines into paragraphs.
> **F4a** `prose_doc.py` lifts leading ATX headings into heading nodes (tiptap.go byte-shape, level≤3) and, given
> `scenes`, sets `attrs.sceneId` on a normalized **unique**-title match (`normalize_title` = exact port of FE
> `SceneAnchor.normalizeTitle`, diacritics significant; ambiguous/duplicate/unmatched → unmarked, never wrong);
> canary extended to pin the Go heading tokens. **F4b** `chapter_scene_drafts` returns `{title,text}` rows; stitch
> input becomes `### <title>\n\n<text>` per scene (`prepend_scene_headings`, skip when already headed); stitch
> prompt gains a keep-headings-verbatim guard (injected only when headings present); the degraded concat carries
> markers deterministically. **F4c** `_persist_chapter_draft(scenes=…)` wired at all 3 chapter persist sites
> (inline chapter-generate, inline stitch, `POST /jobs/{id}/persist` — best-effort scene fetch, never blocks).
> **LIVE E2E** (POC book, Qwen2.5-7B LM Studio): stitch job kept **3/3** `###` headings through the real merge →
> persist → book draft v3 carries 3 heading nodes each with the EXACT outline sceneId (psql-verified, VN titles).
> Caught live: `infra-composition-worker` is a **separate image** from `infra-composition-service` — rebuilding only
> the service left the worker stale (first smoke ran old code). **J1** json-editor is now **multi-instance**:
> `host.openPanel` gains `component` (dock id ≠ catalog component); "Open as JSON" opens
> `json-editor:{docType}:{chapterId}` per chapter (re-open focuses); panel self-titles (`JSON · <id8>`) and no
> longer registers in the host registry (two instances corrupted register/unregister). **Suites:** composition

> **▶ WAVE D — COMPLETE 2026-07-02 (autonomous run, sub-agent build + orchestrator verify).** The autonomy dial's
> full backbone in composition-service: **D2** `authoring_runs` FSM (7 states, OCC-guarded transitions, all-or-nothing
> start-gate: validated plan + scope-fence unique-index (1 active run/book) + budget + allowlist snapshot; sequential
> driver over the REAL drafting seam — EngineDraftingSeam mirrors actions.py's in-process generate_chapter, worker-off
> inline + worker-on 202-poll). **D3** `authoring_run_units` ledger (pre_revision pinned BEFORE each draft — no draft
> without a rollback spine; book-service snapshots every PATCH so latest revision = a TRUE pre-run restore point);
> Run Report (partial-reviewable, downstream indexes); accept/reject (reject restores with the CALLER's bearer,
> restore-failure leaves drafted, cascade_warning); Revert-All (reverse order, closes the run). **D4** durability:
> driver_id+heartbeat, startup+periodic sweep (FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED claim — live-proven on real PG), per-unit
> heartbeat-claim closes the late-result race (late draft lands failed "run closed mid-flight", spend kept);
> completion notify via notification-service HTTP ingest (category=system, operation=autonomous_authoring in
> metadata — mirrors the translation producer); background flag + DRIVER_MAX_INFLIGHT. **D5** per-unit critic wired

> **▶ /review-impl over Wave D — 1 HIGH + 4 MED found, ALL FIXED 2026-07-02 (user: "fix all").**
> **HIGH `6c2ba94e0`:** start-gate false-rejected books >100 chapters — `BookClient.list_chapters` asked limit=200 but
> book-service clamps every page to 100 (chapter-list-limit100 bug class); client now PAGINATES (100/page, 2000 cap),
> all 3 call sites (gate, planner A3, plan verify) see the whole book. **MED fixes (same follow-up commit):**
> (1) late writes driver-fenced — `mark_drafted` gains `run_driver_id`, `record_unit_progress` cursor is CASE-fenced
> (spend always lands); a sweep-STOLEN run's superseded driver can no longer double-draft or rewind the cursor
> (plausible here: worker-off inline has no poll timeout, slow local model >40min → steal). (2) late-swallow now
> RESTORES content — close/fail mid-flight already swallowed the row, but the engine had PATCHed the draft;
> the driver now best-effort restores the pinned pre_revision (honest error_message either way). (3) breaker pauses
> NOTIFY (budget | critic_severe) — 07S "interrupt on severe" now actually reaches the human (same ingest channel).
> (4) book-OWNER-grant may pause/close a collaborator's run (acts AS the run owner; scope fence is per-book, so an
> abandoned grantee run used to lock the book forever; start/resume stay owner-only — they spend the owner's budget).
> **LOW fixes:** deferred-at-cap claim now RELEASED (NULL heartbeat → next sweep picks it up; was a 40-min stall);
> gate maps book-service 401/403 → 403 (was 502 "outage"). New SQL live-proven on real PG (CASE fence, release_claim,
> driver guard). Deferred: `D-RAID-ALLOWLIST-ENFORCE` — tool_allowlist is gate-validated+snapshotted but the v1
> driver never consults it (v1 seam calls no agent tools — vacuously safe; enforcement gate #3 naturally-next-phase,
> lands with agentic tools riding runs). COSMETIC accepted: `level` 3|4 stored, runtime-indistinguishable in v1.

> an OCC stale-version conflict (refetch→retry) — the schema/error-message contracts held. **5 live-caught fixes
> shipped en route (each unit-regression-tested):**
> 1. **Studio nav-kill** — the chat's generic C-NAV executor ran inside the Compose panel; an agent `ui_open_book`
>    on the CURRENT book navigated the SPA to `/books/{id}`, unmounting the WHOLE studio and orphaning the agent's
>    own resumed run (response lost). Fix: `UiNavInterceptorContext` seam in `useUiToolExecutor` +
>    `makeStudioNavInterceptor` (same-book `ui_open_chapter`→`focusManuscriptUnit`, same-book `ui_open_book`/
>    `ui_navigate`→already-here success; cross-book falls through) provided by ComposePanel.
> 2. **book→project bridge** — `composition_get_work` now also accepts `book_id` (resolve_by_book, 0→H13 deny,
>    >1→candidates); the model had dead-ended retrying the book_id AS a project_id (no tool bridged them).
> 3. **CTX-1 position pointer** — `studio_context` now carries `project_id` + `active_chapter_id` (FE: stable
>    `ManuscriptUnitMeta` context — no per-keystroke chat re-render; BE: `StudioContext` model + the system-message
>    note "this book's project is project_id=… (a book_id is NOT a project_id)").
> 4. **composition hot-domain** — the studio compose surface now seeds `composition_*` HOT (`_STUDIO_HOT_DOMAINS`,
>    fresh + resume paths); before, the family was find_tools-lazy and the local model spun in memory/glossary
>    searches concluding "no list_scenes tool exists".
> 5. **Lane-B envelope unwrap** — `chapterIdFromResult` read `chapter_id` top-level but the live stream delivers the
>    chat-service `{ok, result}` TOOL_CALL_RESULT envelope (inner result may be a JSON string) → Scene Rail never
>    reloaded while the DB was already updated (unit tests fed the payload unwrapped — the
>    cross-boundary-normalization bug class, again).
> Also: `manuscriptUnitDocument` TS narrow fix; json-editor empty-buffer-seed commit that was missed from
> `c8906f07a` landed as `a92f10217`. Residual (tracked, not studio-scoped): C-NAV navigation on the PLAIN /chat
> surface still unmounts that page mid-run (same orphaned-resume class — chat-service persists nothing for the
> continuation); intermediate multi-tool turns render "No response generated" chips (cosmetic); knowledge indicator
> flashes "Degraded" occasionally during heavy runs.

> **Caught + fixed a stale test first:** the A2 `contextBudget` CUSTOM frame was never added to the AG-UI happy-path

> (atom-grouped, guarded, summarizer=session model; `effective_limit` threaded into `_stream_with_tools`) so a long

> **What this track is:** the editor/compose UX overhaul **pivoted (PO)** to fixing **output QUALITY first** — POC chapters read as concatenated scenes. Two design docs:
> - **[`docs/specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/`](../specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/)** — the GUI track (validate-first, milestones M0–M5 are a backlog menu, NOT a build order).
> - **[`docs/specs/2026-06-30-chapter-synthesis-self-healing.md`](../specs/2026-06-30-chapter-synthesis-self-healing.md)** — the synthesis track: **Phase 0** (planning connectivity, DO FIRST) → **Phase 2** (multi-pass self-heal). Ordering is locked: garbage-in (disconnected plan) can't be polished out.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (validated, committed):**
> - **Phase 0 slice 1 (intra-chapter connectivity)** — enriched the decompose prompt (goal·conflict·outcome + causality + ending-guided). Fixed the 3 worst reviewer defects (causeless pursuit, grimoire-from-nowhere, disconnected scenes) at the synopsis level, prompt-only.
> - **Phase 0 slice 2 (cross-chapter threading)** — `engine/plan.py`: typed `ChapterExitState` (Character/World/Plot + `advances`) emitted as a same-call delta, threaded chapter→chapter (`thread_state` flag, **default OFF ⇒ today's concurrent fan-out byte-identical**; sequential when ON: prev-chapter exit = fine-grained backbone + cumulative advances = global anti-repeat). Wired through worker + router (additive optional). **Live worker smoke** (Gemma, `thread_state=True`, 12ch/36sc): chapters now open *"Tiếp nối từ…"* the prior exit-state, **arc repetition gone**. `/review-impl`: **0 HIGH**, 4 findings fixed (inline/worker response parity for `exit_state`; both-flags no-op warning; degrade-path test; advances-cap documented). **Tests:** composition unit suite **1180** + slice tests (test_plan 19, router 16, worker_jobs 18 — fixed 5 pre-existing `cancel_check` fake drift) green.
>
> **▶ Self-heal POC — the whole approach was de-risked this session (see the synthesis spec for the data):**
> - **stitch baseline** — the existing 1-pass `stitch` smooths transitions but is NOT a dedup/repair pass, and it **inflates length +68%** (a prompt cleanup did NOT fix it: Gemma rewrites-and-expands by nature; the token cap isn't a clean lever). ⇒ whole-chapter rewrite is the wrong primitive.
> - **L1 dropped** — the "scene-titles mid-chapter" complaint was a POC HARNESS artifact (`to_tiptap_doc` heading-per-scene), not a pipeline defect.
> - **Satellite editing is the answer (PO insight)** — surgical edit of a SMALL isolated span. Mechanism (2) structural isolation works on a small model: `selection-edit` on a 446-char span → ×1.01 length, motif 2→0, meaning preserved (vs whole-chapter ×1.68). Mechanism (1) trust-the-model fails on small models (the stitch result).
> - **The detector must be an LLM JUDGE, not code** (PO) — POC: Gemma returned **7 real findings** (2 logic holes incl. the fall-physics one, emotion-loop, motif, flat villain), each with a `fix` guide, **7/7 locatable (3 exact + 4 fuzzy)** ⇒ the locate step uses **fuzzy/shingle match, not exact**.
> - ⇒ **Full pipeline proven end-to-end:** `LLM JUDGE → fuzzy-locate (code) → satellite-edit (selection-edit) → splice → re-judge loop`. (POC scripts: `poc/judge_poc.py`, harness phases `satellite`/`stitch`.)
>
> **▶ Orchestrator BUILT + live-validated** — `engine/self_heal.py` (`run_self_heal`): judge→fuzzy-`locate_span`→satellite-edit→splice→re-judge; advisory skips (not-located/overlap/runaway-expansion). 12 unit tests. Live on ch1: 6 findings, **6/6 located, 4 edits, length ×1.014** (vs stitch ×1.68), surgical on-target edits. Fixed a false-zero re-judge bug (degraded re-judge now reports None). NOT yet wired to an endpoint (in-container script POC).
>
> **▶ PIVOT (PO) — re-architect PLANNING before drafting.** Reviewing the committed 12-ch plan surfaced many holes at once (no motif binding, empty cast / scene-presence, anonymous new characters, ch1 telescoped). Root cause = `decompose` is **one-shot** (same anti-pattern as whole-chapter stitch). Fix = a multi-step planning pipeline (decompose-and-refine, ONE arc). Spec: [`docs/specs/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline-architecture.md`](../specs/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline-architecture.md) · Build plan + **capability audit** (planning uses ~2/30 engines — the judge constellation promise_audit/succession_entailment/arc_conformance is idle): [`docs/plans/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline.md`](../plans/2026-06-30-planning-pipeline.md). Stages: 0 cast/world · 1 motif-select · 2 arc+tension · 3 char-arc/intro · 4 grounded decompose · 5 plan self-heal · 6 orchestration+checkpoints. Reuse-heavy (motif retriever, templates, arc_apply, self_heal pattern, the idle judges).
>
> **▶ PLANNING PIPELINE COMPLETE (Stages 0–6, all live-validated)** — replaced the one-shot decompose with a multi-step planner, each stage committed + unit-tested + live-POC'd on the Lâm Uyển premise:
> - **0 cast** (`cast_plan.py` propose_cast + `glossary_client.seed_entities`) — 10 cast (6 named + 4 new), seeded → roster → present_entity_ids.
> - **1 motifs** (`motif_plan.py` select_arc_motifs) — 4 arc motifs with roles (spine/recurring/foil/climax).
> - **2 tension** (`arc_plan.py` shape_tension_curve, deterministic) — fixes ch1=100; 100 only at climax.
> - **3 char-arcs** (`character_plan.py` plan_character_arcs) — arcs + introduction schedule (new chars @ fitting beats).
> - **4 grounded decompose** (`grounded_plan.py` + grounding block in `plan.py`) — feeds cast/motifs/tension/intros into the threaded L2.
> - **5 plan self-heal** (`plan_heal.py`) — plan-judge → satellite-edit a scene synopsis by (chapter,scene).
> - **6 orchestration** (`planning_pipeline.py` run_planning_pipeline) — chains 0→1→L1(once)→3→4→5.
> - **Capstone live POC** (`poc/io/full_pipeline.txt`): cast=10 · motifs=4 · arcs=10 · 12ch/30sc/30-with-present · **plan-heal 7/7 findings edited** (4× cross-chapter repetition, a character-before-introduction, a tension-vs-beat, a dangling setup — all real, all fixed).
>
> **▶ Production hardening DONE + the drive STARTED:**
> - **Task A (wired)** — `DecomposeRequest.pipeline=true` → the `/outline/decompose` endpoint runs `run_planning_pipeline` via the worker (`plan_pipeline` op + dispatch + allowlist). **Live e2e:** endpoint→202→worker→cast=9/motifs=4/12ch·35sc/plan-heal 8-8→committed to the outline.
> - **Task B (D-PLAN-CAST-ATTRS, resolved)** — `cast_attributes` maps role/traits/archetype/relationships/summary → the character kind's attr codes; `seed_entities` sends `attributes`+`attribute_actions`. Live-verified: glossary EAV persists role/personality/relationships/description. Drafting grounding now has DEPTH.
> - **Task C (the drive, in progress)** — the full grounded+healed 12-ch plan was generated + committed through the production endpoint; CH1 drafted (grounded) + chapter self-healed (`engine/self_heal.py`) as the prose sample. **NEXT:** draft + self-heal the remaining chapters (drive identically) for the full-story PO evaluation; optional: wire `self_heal` to its own endpoint (currently a script).
> - review-impl on the pipeline: 0 HIGH, 2 MED fixed (motif unrecognised-role drop; L1-once on degrade).

> **▶ Cheap quality stack — judge upgrade (SHIPPED 2026-07-01, `engine/self_heal.py`):** the bare judge
> was blind (0 findings on CH1 while real xưng-hô/canon errors stood; confabulated when prompted broad).
> Root cause = no canon grounding, not model size. POC'd 5 layers on the $0 local Gemma (data:

> (edit whole sentences ⇒ no splice artifact). **Lesson:** voting alone does NOT kill *systematic*

> **x0.997**, incl. the canon contradiction (`từng dốc lòng che chở`→`luôn khinh miệt`) fixed by the grounded

> self_heal **21** (12 legacy + 9 new) green; full composition unit suite green. Result file:
> `poc/io/ch01_healed_cheapstack.txt`. Spec §"Cheap quality stack".
>   - **Full-book drive (CH1–12, book-level canon of all 9 cast) — `story-export-v2/` + `poc/io/heal_v2_summary.json`:**
>     **modern pronouns `ông/bà/ông ta/bà ta` = 0 real residuals book-wide** (deterministic prefilter is the
>     reliable workhorse); **no inflation anywhere** (x0.998–1.005). Two honest findings: (1) **verify is
>     stochastic + fail-toward-refute → occasionally drops a real finding** (CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` regressed
>     vs the dedicated run; refuted=5/5 on CH03) — a precision/recall knob to tune (lower aggression, or vote
>     the verify), the human gate still matters most for the *semantic* findings. (2) **bug FIXED this commit:**
>     the dup-word collapser would flatten VALID Vietnamese reduplication (`chằm chằm`, `rắc rắc`) — now gated
>     OFF for `_REDUP_LANGS` (vi/zh/ja/ko/th/id/ms); only NFD-diacritic luck spared the v2 corpus, so the
>     exported v2 prose is unaffected.
>   - **(A) verify-recall + (B) canon-from-pipeline — SHIPPED 2026-07-01:**
>     **(A)** `run_self_heal(verify_k=…)` VOTES the verify (`_verify_vote`, majority-refute, tie→keep) so a
>     stochastic single refute can't drop a real finding. **(B)** new `engine/heal_canon.py`
>     (`render_canon` / `convention_for` / `canon_from_proposed`) builds the heal bible from the SAME
>     designed cast drafting grounds on; `PipelineResult.canon` now carries it (rendered in
>     `run_planning_pipeline`). **Live-validated on CH1** ($0 local, canon auto-rendered 2701 chars,
>     `verify_k=3`): the CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` false-refute is **GONE** (residual=False; refuted 4→1), and
>     the rendered canon enabled a new canon catch (Hắc Sát Lão Nhân's role). Tests: self_heal 24 +
>     heal_canon 5.
>   - **⚠ CORRECTION (full-book re-drive, 2026-07-01) — the verify_k=3 "fix" was a lucky dedicated-run
>     sample.** Re-driving CH1–12 (`heal_all_v3.py` → `story-export-v3/` + `poc/io/heal_v3_summary.json`):
>     **pronouns ông/bà = 0 book-wide** (deterministic prefilter — rock-solid), **no inflation** (x0.998–1.007),
>     BUT **CH01 `mẫu thân ngươi` STILL residual** (present in both v2 and v3). Two real findings: (1) the
>     verify-vote was **mis-tuned** — majority-refute on a "default-REFUTED" prompt COMPOUNDS the refute-lean
>     (over-refuted: CH11 4/4, CH12 7/7). **Fixed:** `_verify_vote` now drops only on a **UNANIMOUS** refute
>     (keep if any vote confirms) — recall-biased, the human gate culls the rest. (2) **The verify model has a
>     genuine BLIND SPOT on `mẫu thân ngươi`** — it refutes 3/3 even grounded + recall-biased (0 confirms), so
>     NO vote threshold rescues it. **Conclusion (validates the M6 design):** the cheap stack is reliable on
>     CLOSED-CLASS (pronouns/dup, deterministic); semantic blind-spots are real + bounded → that residue is

>   - **★ REDESIGN — DIRECT high-recall propose (PO diagnosis, 2026-07-01): the JUDGE pipeline was the bug,
>     not self-heal.** PO proved a BARE prompt on the same Gemma finds 7 splice-ready `{original,replacement,
>     explanation}` edits where our `judge→vote→verify→satellite` chain kept ~4 (verify default-REFUTED muted
>     real edits → v2≈v3). "The model detects + proposes correctly; only the judge is dumb." **Fix shipped:**
>     `propose_self_heal` now uses **`propose_edits_direct`** — ONE high-recall judge call that emits the
>     replacement inline (`build_direct_judge_messages`/`parse_direct_findings`), must-quote locate + dup-word
>     merge, **NO vote/verify** (the human gate IS the filter). Canon is CONTEXT, not a suppression guardrail.
>     **Live CH1:** 5 splice-ready edits incl. `mẫu thân ngươi`→`của ta` AND the canon contradiction
>     `dốc lòng che chở`→`khinh miệt` — the two cases the old pipeline never fixed — in 1 call (vs vote×5+verify×3).

>   - **★ "Make the judge smart" — (1) surface rules + (2) comparative re-ranker (2026-07-01).** Smart-judge
>     POC pinned the root cause: the verifier wasn't dumb, it was **UNDERFED** — the rule was BURIED in an
>     800–2700-char bible. Fed the SAME rule concisely + with the example, EVEN the old skeptical judge
>     confirms `mẫu thân ngươi` 3/3 AND refutes the `lão` confab 3/3 (`poc/smart_judge_poc.py`). Two fixes:

> **▶ Broader evaluation pass — DONE 2026-07-01 (`tests/e2e/eval_compose_quality.py` + `docs/specs/2026-06-30-editor-compose-overhaul/eval/2026-07-01-quality-eval.md`).** Drove all 3 surfaces × 12 real chapters + book coverage. Verdict: **critic** (10/10 violations real, 0 FP) + **book coverage** (v2, after windowing) are trustworthy; **self-heal** good (49 props, 0 no-ops) but hides its objective wins; the **per-chapter "dropped promises" is a false-positive machine** (30 flagged vs 0 abandoned book-wide — v1 audit mislabels still-*progressing* threads as dropped; the LLM's own "chưa/not-yet" annotations prove it). Ranked backlog below.
>
> **▶ Deferred (this track):**
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-DROPPED-FP**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01 (backlog #1).** The per-chapter Quality Report promise section is reframed from the misleading "dropped promises" alarm to **"threads RAISED in this chapter"** (informational) + any RESOLVED here; the false-positive "dropped" verdict is gone, and the book-level coverage owns paid/abandoned. `quality_report` now returns `{critic, threads:{raised, resolved, raised_count, resolved_count}}` (was `{critic, promises:{...dropped...}}`); `_chapter_threads` reshapes the audit; FE `QualityThreads` + `QualityReportSection` render "N thread(s) raised" (neutral) + "M paid off here" (green). E2E-confirmed (`raised` present, `dropped` absent). Tests: quality_report + worker + FE QualityReportSection updated green.
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-HONORIFIC-PRECHECK**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01 (backlog #2).** Data-driven: re-ran the eval with rerank=ON — the LLM re-ranker only pre-checked **8/15** honorific fixes (misclassifies ~half as CRAFT) at the cost of 49 extra calls. So "default rerank ON" was the WRONG fix. Instead: `self_heal._is_convention_fix(type)` code-detects the objective xưng-hô/address/typo class (a closed convention the auditor labels) and pre-checks it **deterministically + FREE** — even with rerank OFF, and it short-circuits the re-ranker when ON. E2E-confirmed on real ch1: 4/4 ADDRESS/HONORIFIC pre-checked, LOGIC/REPEATED (CRAFT) left unchecked. Tests: self_heal 34 (+3: _is_convention_fix, precheck-without/with-rerank).
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-CRITIC-HEAL-LINK**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01 (backlog #3).** The critic's canon violations ≈ self-heal's honorific edits (same issue, shown as diagnostic AND edit). `QualityReportSection` now takes the current `proposals` and marks each critic violation whose `span` overlaps a proposal's `before` with a **"fix proposed ↓"** badge (`_hasProposedFix`, normalized substring-either-way, min-len guard) — so the author sees "this violation already has a fix below" instead of double-counting. FE-only; PolishPanel passes `p.proposals`. Tests: QualityReportSection +2 (match / no-match); FE composition 737.
> - **D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-VARIANCE — LOW, DEFERRED (backlog #5, conscious).** Book-coverage paid↔progressing flips run-to-run (LM Studio/Gemma isn't fully deterministic even at temp 0). Stabilizing = a multi-sample majority vote per window = 3× the LLM cost for marginal gain on an ADVISORY signal. Gate #4 — fix only if the variance ever misleads a real decision. Trigger: a user reports a promise's verdict flipping confusingly.
> - **D-QUALITY-CH4-REGEN — LOW, NOT-A-CODE-FIX (backlog #4, conscious).** ch4's draft has a repetition LOOP; both critic (coh=2, "looping") and self-heal (10 "repeated") correctly flagged it — i.e. the TOOLS WORK. The resolution is regenerating ch4's DATA (a generation op), not a code change; near-zero product value on one POC chapter. Won't-fix as code; regenerate the draft opportunistically if the POC book is re-driven.
> - **D-QUALITY-MOTIF-ROLLUP** — surface `motif_conformance` beat-not-realized per chapter in the Quality Report (needs per-outline-node motif bindings aggregated across scenes). Gate #2 (structural). Target: a Q-follow-on to the Quality Report track.
> - ~~**D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-CHUNK**~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-07-01** (found by E2E → fixed → E2E-confirmed, the full loop). `build_promise_coverage` now WINDOWS the book (`_split_windows`, 12K-char paragraph-aligned) and scores each window against the same fixed promise set, MERGING per-promise by strongest engagement (paid > progressing > abandoned > absent); all windows failing → honest `coverage_unavailable`. **E2E-confirmed on the real 12-ch book:** was `coverage_unavailable` + all-10-absent → now `error:None`, 9 promises all **"progressing"** (a sensible read of a setup-heavy opening: promises live, none resolved/dropped yet). Tests: quality_report 12 (+3 windowing) + an E2E regression guard (`error != coverage_unavailable`).
>
> **▶ E2E harness — SHIPPED 2026-07-01 (`9687f6910`), replaces live-smoke/POC (per user).** `tests/e2e/quality_harness.py` + `tests/e2e/test_compose_quality_e2e.py`: drives the REAL `/v1/composition/*` quality endpoints through the gateway as the claude-test account, discovering a real target black-box (books → work → a DRAFTED chapter → chat model) + job-poll. 4 E2E green. First run surfaced (a) a STALE-IMAGE trap (running composition image predated the endpoints → 404; rebuilt composition-service+worker) and (b) the coverage-chunk bug above — both invisible to a crafted-input smoke. **Methodology (LOCKED, see memory `prefer-e2e-and-evaluation-over-live-smoke-poc`):** validate compose-quality via real E2E + evaluation analysis over the real book, not hand-fed smoke. **NEXT:** either fix D-QUALITY-COVERAGE-CHUNK (make Q3 work on real books) or run a broader evaluation pass across all 3 surfaces × 12 chapters to build the improvement backlog.
> - **D-ARC-TEMPLATE-CRUD-GUI / D-MOTIF-LIBRARY-CRUD-GUI** — auto arc-conformance + the motif-library judges are gated on GUI-managed artifacts (arc templates only from reference-import/authored; no `work→arc_template` link). Making them useful needs whole CRUD GUIs — big features. Gate #2 (structural). Target: discuss + plan as their own features.
> - **Recently cleared:** ~~D-QUALITY-ARC-LEVEL~~ — SHIPPED as Q3 (book-level promise coverage, 2026-07-01).
> - **D-THREAD-MOTIF-COMBINED** — `thread_state` + `motifs_enabled` together: typed-state threading is skipped on the motif path (motif `prev_effects` carry used; warned, not silent). Gate #2 (needs interleaving the motif sequential select with the threaded invent loop). Target: when motifs + threading are both wanted in one run.
> - **Book-service universal formatter** (slice 01: `tiptap.go`/`server.go` markdown→Tiptap) — built, **uncommitted**, awaiting the PO's read-mode test before a separate commit.
> - GUI milestones M0–M5 — paused behind the synthesis track (output quality first).

>
> **▶ FOUNDATION FULLY HARDENED + COMPLETE (incl. close_fact).**
>
> **▶ BACKEND FANOUT COMPLETE (X1–X5, X7) — consumers now read bi-temporal knowledge through the KAL; both
> INV-KAL lints ENFORCED:**
> - **X1 composition** `ae4016ea` — `KalClient.roster` DRAINS `next_cursor` (fixes the D4 truncation-at-100 bug);
>   `_cast_roster` migrated; dead `list_entities` removed. 1181 tests green.
> - **X2 lore-enrichment** `9af1c255` — `KalClient` (roster drain + facts/canonical/search); full-book cast from
>   the drained roster. Residual: `kind`/`short_description` supplemented from the authored entity-list (catalog,
>   not bi-temporal — out of INV-KAL scope, like the table-read gate's `glossary_entities` exemption).
> - **X5 translation** `0471b48c` — `KalClient` (get_facts/get_canonical) with **as-of-N inject** (threads
>   `chapter_sort_order`) + **immutable-once cache** (keyed on chapter content-hash + as-of). Default (no
>   `KNOWLEDGE_GATEWAY_URL`) byte-identical to today.
> - **X3 wiki / X4 chat — verified NO-OPs:** wiki is owner-side (glossary, lint-exempt); chat's entity reads are
>   MCP tools federated by name through ai-gateway (MCP-first invariant — must stay that way). No dead code added.
> - **X7** `7fb6e692` — built the INV-KAL **HTTP-surface lint** (was DEFERRED `D-KAL-HTTP-SURFACE-LINT`); BOTH
>   halves now ENFORCED in pre-commit. Both lints PASS full-scan (zero direct bi-temporal knowledge reads in consumers).
> - **KAL in docker-compose** `b695ab7d` — built + healthy in-stack; cross-service smoke: composition container →
>   `knowledge-gateway:3000` roster returns the contract shape.
>
> **▶ X6a/b — FE→KAL bridge DONE + live-verified** `bf772913` (PO: dual-auth chosen):
> - **KAL dual-auth** (read surface; writes stay internal-only): SERVICE mode (X-Internal-Token) OR USER mode —
>   validate the platform HS256 Bearer JWT (Node crypto, no dep; rejects alg=none/wrong-sig/expired, timing-safe) +
>   GRANT-CHECK the book against book-service (`/internal/books/{id}/access`) since the BFF is a dumb proxy. X-User-Id
>   PINNED from the JWT sub (anti-spoof). Fail-closed + 5s grant timeout + bounded positive-grant cache.
> - **BFF** `/v1/kal` → knowledge-gateway (dumb JWT passthrough, 503-on-down). KAL compose env: JWT_SECRET + BOOK_SERVICE_URL.
> - **Reviewed** (/review-impl: MED grant-timeout + LOW cache-bound fixed) + **live-smoked** the full FE path with a

>
> **▶ ONLY REMAINING: X6c — the net-new FE TEMPORAL SURFACES (React, this branch):** canonical card (as-of folded
> canonical), time/version slider (scrub chapter ordinal), change timeline w/ citations, diff view (state between two
> ordinals), retrieval-not-scroll, per-episode translation (§7). Reads go through the BFF `/v1/kal/*` (now live).
>
> **▶ REMAINING = the consumer/FE FANOUT (parallel worktree agents, the locked strategy):**
> X1 composition→KAL (+fix `_cast_roster` cursor drain) · X2 lore-enrichment→KAL · X3 wiki→KAL (kill direct-EAV) ·
> X4 chat→KAL · X5 translation→KAL (as-of inject + immutable-once cache) · X6 FE temporal surfaces (canonical card,
> time slider, change timeline, diff, retrieval) + migrate FE reads to KAL · X7 flip BOTH INV-KAL lints (table-read +
> the new HTTP-surface lint) to ENFORCING. Each binds ONLY to the frozen `kal.v1.yaml` → provably disjoint, parallel-safe.

> **▶ Shipped this run (production-ready, all verified on real DB / build / tests):**
> - **F1d (producer)** `d5662b64` — facts FLOW from extraction: translation worker passes `chapter_ordinal`,
>   glossary writeback ingests the episode + opens append-only facts per written attr, idempotent. (`TestBulkExtract_EmitsTemporalFacts`)
> - **F4-live core** `c13d11bb` — glossary `/internal/facts/*`: GET facts/timeline/attr-values (bounded, as-of) + POST
>   episode/append/retract; KAL paths aligned. (`TestFactsHTTP`: append supersedes, retract restitches over the router)
> - **F4-writes** `41070247` — internal merge/resolve-entity/split routes + KAL wiring (resolve-or-create idempotent).
> - **in-story dates** `a5d0d80e` (merged) — `event_date_iso` additive valid-time on KG facts/relations (19 tests; chapter-ordinal stays primary).
> - **prod bugfix** `94caea91` — world-timeline `NameError: q` (pre-existing crash) fixed.
>
> **▶ Remaining foundation (then fanout):**
> - **F2-app — fold handler:** dirty queue + canonical_snapshot write + lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground
>   (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff. LLM via provider-registry (likely a worker/knowledge pass like #26/#7 summarize).
>   Makes `get_canonical` return the FOLDED canonical (today it serves canon-content). Adds the KAL `fold` route.
> - **F1g — bi-temporal names:** name as `fact_kind='name'` (single) + aliases as `'alias'` (multi); as-of-name; resolver
>   matches the across-time alias set. RECONCILE: migration 0048 converts the cold-start/F1d `attribute` name/aliases
>   facts → name/alias kind, and `refreshEAVProjection` + the D5 check must project name-kind facts to the name EAV.
> - then **fanout X1–X7** (parallel worktree agents per the locked strategy).


> **What this branch is:** implementing the Incremental Temporal Knowledge Architecture
> ([spec](../specs/2026-06-29-incremental-temporal-knowledge-architecture.md) §12/§12.7.8 govern;
> [plan](../plans/2026-06-30-temporal-knowledge-architecture-impl.md)). Append-only bi-temporal facts as the
> sole SSOT (INV-FACTS §12.0); everything else a rebuildable cache. Execution = **serial foundation → parallel
> fanout** (user-directed: build foundation serially, checkpoint, then fan out consumer migrations).
>
> **▶ Shipped this session — the SSOT substrate spine, all real-DB verified on `loreweave_glossary`:**
> - **F0** `fc4c9a80` — froze the **KAL v1 contract** (`contracts/api/knowledge-gateway/kal.v1.yaml`), the keystone
>   every consumer binds to; `knowledge-gateway: missing` row in `language-rule.yaml` (→ typescript at F4 scaffold).
> - **F1a** `ae6f17fd` — `0044` **entity_facts + episodes** bi-temporal SSOT schema (content-addressed natural key,
>   `valid_to_eff` INT64_MAX null-sink, `coverage_xid` xid8, merge_journal fact/episode-move cols). Idempotent 2×.
> - **F1b** `728efaf9` — `0045` **maintain_chain** the single `valid_to` writer (§12.3.3). Verified all 3 scenarios:
>   out-of-order backfill (A2), retract restitch (A3), oscillation (A4).
> - **F1c** `8a2b8e6d` — **fact core** Go (`facts.go`): appendFact (idempotent NK), retractFacts (restitch),
>   ingestEpisode, refreshEAVProjection (repair/cutover), per-(entity,attr) chain lock. `TestFactCore` PASSES (real DB).
> - **F1h** `8eb419f9` — `0046` **cold-start seed**: 22,056 facts seeded from live EAV; **projection==flat_eav 0 mismatches** (§12.5.4/D5).
> - **F2 schema** `fdf6c0d8` — `0047` **canonical versioned-cache** tables (canonical_snapshot + canonical_fold_state), §12.1.
>
> ⚠ Migrations **0044–0047 are applied to the running dev `loreweave_glossary`** (by F1c's `RunChain`); a fresh stack
> picks them up from the ledger on boot.
>
> **▶ PARALLEL track (background agent, worktree):** **F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify** in `knowledge-service`
> (Python/Neo4j) — substrate-independent from glossary. Ordinal valid-time unified with `from_order`, ordinal-aware
> close (A2 on the KG side), extraction-driven invalidate/retract, quote-on-citation, per-entity ordinal snapshot.
> **Merge its worktree branch at the integration node before F4.**
>
> **▶ F3 — KG ordinal valid-time unify — MERGED `f2d5ca3e`** (was a parallel worktree agent); 24 F3 unit tests
> re-verified green post-merge. All under `services/knowledge-service/` (disjoint from glossary).
>
> **▶ F1f — fact-chain merge + split (DONE):** `ecc7e587` **merge** (§12.4.1, `mergeFactChains`/`revertFactChains`,
> journal `repointed_fact_ids`+`invalidated_fact_ids`, same-ordinal tiebreak, chain locks both sides) +
> `f52e50f7` **split** (§12.4.2, `splitFactsByEpisode` re-attribute-by-provenance, originals reason='split').
> `TestMergeFactChains`/`TestSplitFactsByEpisode` green; existing Merge/Revert/Dedup suites green (no regression).
>
> **▶ F4 — KAL gateway service + INV-KAL lint (DONE, structure):**
> - `2ab5f710` **KAL NestJS service** (`services/knowledge-gateway`) implementing `kal.v1.yaml`: config/main/health +
>   `KalReadController` (get_canonical/get_facts/timeline/list_attr_values/roster/search/neighborhood/retrieve, each with
>   per-substrate `temporal_capability`, KG `as_of` dropped when `temporal_unsupported`) + `KalWriteController`
>   (append/close/retract/merge/split/fold/ingest_episode/resolve_entity forwarding to glossary `/internal/facts/*`).
>   **Verified: npm install + nest build clean; boots + serves /health + /health/ready (kgTemporal=ordinal_valid_time),
>   16 routes mapped.** `language-rule.yaml` `missing`→`typescript`; lint PASS.
> - `434894d8` **INV-KAL table-read lint** (`scripts/knowledge-access-gate.py`, wired into `.githooks/pre-commit`): no
>   consumer reads the glossary EAV / Neo4j directly. Full-scan PASS.
>
> **▶ NEXT — F4-FOLLOW-ON + remaining foundation, then fanout:**
> 1. **F4-follow-on (live writes):** add the glossary **`/internal/facts/*` HTTP routes** (Go handlers wrapping the F1c/F1f
>    fact core — appendFact/retract/mergeFactChains/splitFactsByEpisode/fold) so the KAL write verbs hit a real target;
>    then a **cross-service live-smoke** (KAL → glossary fact route → DB) + verify the read endpoints' downstream path
>    mapping against the actual glossary/KG routes. (KAL reads/writes build + the service boots; full delegation is the
>    cross-service smoke, currently unverified end-to-end.)
> 2. **F2 app** — the fold handler: lazy rebuild-on-read + ordinal-bucketed re-ground (B1) + compare-and-clear + backoff
>    (needs a provider-registry LLM call). Enhances `get_canonical` behind the frozen contract.
> 3. **F1g** — bi-temporal name/aliases (§12.4.3) + as-of-name. **Value partly gated on F1d** (deferred writeback wiring);
>    reconciles `D-TK-F1G-NAME-RECONCILE`.
> 4. **CHECKPOINT** → then parallel **fanout** X1–X7 (consumer migrations onto the KAL, FE temporal surfaces).
>
> **▶ SCOPE (locked 2026-06-30): this branch is the PRODUCTION-READY refactor — NO deferrals.** Everything below is
> in-branch work to COMPLETE (the repo adopts the KAL immediately after merge, so nothing core may be stubbed/parked).
> Includes the full consumer + FE fanout (X1–X7) and both INV-KAL lints flipped to ENFORCING. The items that were
> "deferred" are now must-complete work:
> - **F1d — writeback Path-A emission (must complete):** wire fact emission into the glossary writeback; extend the
>   bulk-extract request with `chapter_ordinal` and update the translation-service extraction caller to pass it.

All 3 facts tests green on real DB; cold-start re-verified `projection==flat_eav` 0 mismatches with the `-1` sentinel.

# ▶▶ (prior) **Motif book-collaboration tier (model B) + shared-graph links + MCP edit SHIPPED** · branch `feat/narrative-pattern-library` · HEAD `8c4c45c2`+ · 2026-06-29

> **▶ MERGE 2026-06-29:** `origin/main` merged into this branch (179 commits — the **public-MCP gateway + lazy tool-loading** track, critical-UX fixes, glossary/knowledge/campaign work). Conflicts resolved (composition `actions.py` confirm = JWT-identity ∪ public-MCP spend-attribution; engine `plan.py`/`stitch.py` signatures = both; studio panels = `canonview` ∪ `motifs`/`conformance`; gateway test `mcpPublicGatewayUrl`). The motif MCP tools are exposed to the public-MCP gateway: `find_tools` (lazy discovery) picks them up dynamically from the federation catalog, and they are classified in the edge `TOOL_POLICY` allowlist (commit `2aa65765`). Below is this branch's motif work; the merged-in main tracks + all prior history are archived (see the pointer at the bottom).

> **▶ Follow-up this session (2nd commit) — both model-B deferrals CLOSED:** `D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER` (shared-graph link editing — guard rewrite + repo/MCP book_id paths) and `D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED` (the `composition_motif_patch` MCP edit tool). Details in the "Deferred … BOTH NOW CLEARED" block below. 150 motif unit tests + 38 motif DB integration tests green; migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`; provider-gate clean.

> **▶ Shipped this session — the two NEW future-feature rows (now CLOSED):**
> - **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER` (model B) — a THIRD tenancy tier (the book SHARED library).** Spec: [docs/specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md](../specs/2026-06-29-motif-book-collab-tier.md). A `motif.book_shared=true` row is owned by its creator (attribution) but VISIBLE to the book's VIEW-grantees and WRITABLE by its EDIT-grantees — access is the **book grant resolved at the caller**, never row ownership. User decisions (this session): **context-scoped reads** (per-book gate, no global "all my books"), **any-EDIT-grantee writes** (edit + archive), **adopt + create + mine** all produce shared rows. The base read predicate is **UNCHANGED** (a foreign shared row is fail-closed invisible to get_visible/list_for_caller/catalog/get_by_codes); shared rows surface ONLY through the gated book-context methods. Touch-points: schema (`book_shared` col + `motif_book_shared_shape` CHECK [shared ⇒ book+owner+private, the public-catalog-orthogonality guard] + per-book `uq_motif_book_shared` + re-narrowed `uq_motif_user_book WHERE …AND NOT book_shared`); repo (`clone/adopt/create/_clone_with_code` thread book_shared; new `list_in_book/get_in_book/patch_shared/archive_shared`; adopt locks per-BOOK + dedups per-(book,code) for the shared tier); MCP (`adopt target=book_shared`, `create target=book_shared`, `mine promote_target=book_shared`, `archive book_id=`, new `composition_motif_book_list`); confirm dispatch (`book_shared` rides the payload, re-gated EDIT); FE (3rd adopt target "Share with collaborators" + `Shared` badge).
> - **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK` — HTTP parity.** `POST /motifs/{id}/adopt` now takes `target=user|book|book_shared`+`book_id`, **EDIT-gated before the clone** (no softer than MCP); `GET /motifs/book/{id}` (VIEW-gated list); `PATCH`/`DELETE …?book_id=` (EDIT-gated shared edit/archive, visibility-flip refused 400). A book-shared pattern root does NOT auto-adopt its members (the half-shared-pattern guard).
>
> **VERIFY:** 90 motif unit tests + new repo/mcp/router cases green; **integration (real PG)**: new `test_motif_book_shared_db.py` (shape CHECK, per-book dedup, list/get scoping, any-grantee patch/archive) + 32 existing motif DB tests pass on a throwaway DB; **migration live-smoked idempotent on the REAL existing model-A `loreweave_composition`** (added book_shared col + CHECK + uq_motif_book_shared + re-narrowed uq_motif_user_book; two runs, no error). FE 152 motif tests + tsc + provider-gate clean. **`/review-impl` adversarial tenancy review: 0 HIGH / 0 MED** — all 9 read/write/leak/confirm/dedup checks PASS with file:line evidence; 3 LOW/COSMETIC notes (deferred below).
>
> **▶ Deferred (from the model-B review — BOTH NOW CLEARED 2026-06-29):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-LINK-SHARED-TIER`** — **CLEARED:** the `motif_link_guard` was rewritten (NULL-safe) to a precise 3-arm same-tier rule — both SYSTEM, or both the SAME book's SHARED tier (owners may differ — the point of a collaborator graph), or both the SAME user's PRIVATE tier. A shared↔private/system/cross-book link is rejected at the DB. Repo `list_links/create_link/delete_link` gained a `book_id` path (anchor via get_in_book; both endpoints must be `book_shared AND book_id`); MCP link tools take `book_id` (VIEW for list, EDIT for create/delete). Live-PG tested (same-book allowed, 3 cross-tier rejections, 3rd-grantee list/delete) + migration re-smoked idempotent on real `loreweave_composition`. **Caught+fixed a SQL three-valued-logic bug**: `owner = owner` with a NULL operand yields NULL so `IF NOT NULL` wouldn't fire (a user→system link would have slipped) — every arm is now NULL-guarded.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-MCP-PATCH-SHARED`** — **CLEARED:** new `composition_motif_patch` MCP tool (Tier-A) — owner-keyed by default, or a SHARED-tier edit with `book_id` (EDIT-gated → patch_shared). Optimistic-lock `expected_version` (stale → applied_conflict), visibility/publish deliberately NOT editable (separate flow), honest undo that patches changed fields back to prior values. Owner path denies a foreign row before any write; shared path confirms the row is shared-in-this-book.

> # ▶▶ (prior) **Motif library COMPLETE — audit 7/7 closed (WI-1…WI-6)** · HEAD `04bab448`+ · 2026-06-29

> **What this branch is:** the narrative-pattern (motif/arc) library — Tier-W cost-gated MCP flows for mining, conformance, adopt, and 3-way publish-sync, fronted by the FE→MCP-tool bridge. The feature body landed across prior sessions; this session closed the **completeness-audit tail** AND shipped **WI-5 per-book adopt**.
>
> **▶ Shipped this session (all green — 1083+ backend unit + 151 FE motif tests, tsc + provider-gate clean):**
> - **Audit tail (committed `f1157b25`…`b8f0ddb3`):** BYOK model_ref threading through `motif_mine`/`arc_import`; the **tag-beats LLM extractor** (knowledge `POST /internal/extraction/tag-beats` → composition mine pre-pass; cross-tenant injection neutralized); **WI-3 arc semantic retrieve** (`composition_arc_suggest`); **WI-1/WI-2/WI-4 FE** (mine panel, full editor, publish-sync); `/review-impl` fixes (arc back-fill scoped to own/system; editor edit-loss). Completeness audit: [`docs/reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md`](../reports/2026-06-29-motif-completeness-audit.md).
> - **WI-5 per-book adopt (`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-PER-BOOK`) — model A "book-scoped filter" (user-chosen, NOT the tier-reversal):** `motif.book_id` is a per-book LABEL on a clone the adopter still owns. The read predicate + 2-tier tenancy are **UNCHANGED** (book_id only narrows the owner's view, never widens visibility). Design: [`docs/plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md`](../plans/2026-06-29-motif-adopt-per-book.md). Touch-points: schema (`book_id` col + `uq_motif_user` scoped to `book_id IS NULL` + new `uq_motif_user_book` partial + `idx_motif_book`); `MotifRepo.clone/adopt/_clone_with_code/list_for_caller`; `_MotifAdoptArgs.target=Literal['user','book']`+`book_id` (EDIT-gated at propose **and** confirm); FE adopt-to-book toggle (api/hook/AdoptTargetModal/MotifLibraryView). **Live-smoked** on real `loreweave_composition`: migration idempotent; global+per-book coexist; same-book dup blocked by `uq_motif_user_book`; 0 leaked rows.
> - **WI-6 motif_link edge-walk (`D-MOTIF-LINK-EDGEWALK`) — the FINAL §5 gap, closing the audit 7/7:** 3 MCP tools — `composition_motif_link_list` (R, traverse out/in/both with neighbor code+name), `composition_motif_link_create` + `_delete` (A). User-scoped; WRITE requires **BOTH endpoints owned by the caller** (the system↔system hole the DB `motif_link_guard` same-tier check misses — a user may never reshape the shared graph). `MotifRepo.list_links/create_link/delete_link`. **Live-smoked**: own→own create/list/delete OK; own→system rejected by the guard; 0 leaked rows. The completeness audit is now **7/7 closed, nothing deferred**.
>
> **⚠ Two already-built misfires earlier this session** (memory [[verify-built-before-building]]): `D-W8-MOTIF-BEAT-EXTRACTOR` and `D-MOTIF-SYNC-3WAY-BASE` backend were **already shipped** — I rebuilt a duplicate sync router and reverted it (`a24d99ea`). **Before building ANY "missing"/deferred motif item: `git grep` the route/module/test first.**
>
> **▶ NEXT:** **PR `feat/narrative-pattern-library` → main** — the feature body + audit tail + WI-5 are complete, green, and live-smoked. (Note: the WI-5 migration was applied to the *running* dev `loreweave_composition` by the live-smoke; a fresh stack picks it up from `migrate.py` on boot.)
>
> **▶ Deferred (motif — the §5 audit tail is 7/7 CLOSED; these were NEW future-feature rows):**
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-ADOPT-BOOK-COLLAB-TIER`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** model B shipped (see the top block). The shared book tier landed with a 0-HIGH/0-MED adversarial tenancy review.
> - ✅ **`D-MOTIF-HTTP-ADOPT-BOOK`** — **CLEARED (2026-06-29):** the HTTP adopt route exposes `target`+`book_id`, EDIT-gated (see the top block).
