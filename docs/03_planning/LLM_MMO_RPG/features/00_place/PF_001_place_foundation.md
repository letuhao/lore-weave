# PF_001 — Place Foundation

> **⚠ CLOSURE-PASS-EXTENSION 2026-04-27 — DF05_001 Session/Group Chat CANDIDATE-LOCK 71a60346:**
>
> Cell-tier session capacity tracking — DF05_001 enforces ≤50 Active sessions per cell V1 per DF5-A8 (cross-validator C28 in `_boundaries/03_validator_pipeline_slots.md`). PF_001 cell display UI may surface "5 active conversations" indicator at cell-tier (V1+30d cosmetic UX; not blocking V1 ship). DF5-C2 cross-aggregate validator: session.channel_id MUST be cell-tier (non-cell channels rejected) — DF05_001 verifies via PF_001 §5 cell-only invariant. NO change to PF_001 aggregate or cell-tier 1:1 invariant; CANDIDATE-LOCK status PRESERVED. LOW magnitude — pure consumer of cell-tier semantics + display UX hook.

> **Conversational name:** "Place Foundation" (PF). The semantic substrate that defines what counts as a meaningful in-fiction location — a `place` aggregate per cell channel, a closed `PlaceType` taxonomy, an explicit connection graph for Travel, structural state machine for in-fiction degradation, fixture seed declarations for canonical EnvObjects, RealityManifest extension for bootstrap, and time-lapse evolution hooks (author-edit + in-fiction-event V1; scheduled decay V1+30d).

## §1 Why this exists

Three concrete gaps in the V1 design surface that PF_001 closes:

**Gap 1 — Spawn mechanically possible, narratively empty.** PL_001 §16 RealityManifest has `root_channel_tree` (continent/country/district/town/cell hierarchy) + `canonical_actors`. Bootstrap can place an actor at a cell — but a cell is just a channel + scene_state (ambient: weather, crowd, freeform `notable_props` strings). There's no semantic identity: PlaceType (tavern? forest? throne room?), canon-grounded description, fixture inventory (EnvObjects), or connection graph for Travel destinations. When PC arrives, LLM has insufficient context for scene narration.

**Gap 2 — EF_001 EnvObject variant orphaned.** EF_001 declared `EnvObject(EnvObjectId)` as a V1 EntityId variant (door, wall, table, statue addressable for Examine). But no feature owned the entry point: who declares "this tavern has a door, a counter, a fireplace at canonical seed time"? PL_001 RealityManifest didn't have `canonical_env_objects`. EnvObjects must originate somewhere V1 — PF_001 fixture-seed declarations are that origin.

**Gap 3 — Time-lapse undefined.** PL_001 fiction_clock advances but no feature owned "places evolve when fiction-time advances OR in-fiction events propagate". Three real V1 scenarios untouched:
- Author-edit (Forge): "the tavern is now boarded up" — needs a write path
- In-fiction event: PC Strikes the wall enough times → tavern damaged → references to fixtures behind that wall now fail → cascade into EF_001 lifecycle
- V1+30d scheduled decay: forest grows back after fire; market crowds peak at midday — Generator framework was built but no feature consumed it for places

PF_001 owns the semantic foundation; consumer features (PCS_001 / NPC_001 / future EnvObject / future Item / future Quest) inherit place context.

## §2 Domain concepts

| Concept | Maps to | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **PlaceId** | Newtype `pub struct PlaceId(pub ChannelId)` — V1 1:1 with cell channels | Place identity = the cell channel ID. Higher-tier channels (continent/country/district/town) DO NOT have place rows V1 (aggregation tiers, not in-fiction places). V1+ multi-place-per-cell deferred (PF-D4). |
| **PlaceType** | Closed enum 10 V1 kinds (see §4) | `Residence \| Tavern \| Marketplace \| Temple \| Workshop \| OfficialHall \| Road \| Crossroads \| Wilderness \| Cave`. V1+ reservations (PF-D1): `Dungeon \| Battlefield \| Vehicle \| ShipDeck \| DreamRealm \| etc.` |
| **StructuralState** | Closed enum 4-state — `Pristine \| Damaged \| Destroyed \| Restored` | "Restored" explicitly distinct from Pristine — preserves audit precision (rebuilt-after-destruction differs from original-untouched). Forbidden transitions enforced at write-time (§7). |
| **NarrativeDrift** | Freeform `serde_json::Value` field on `place` | Per-reality drift accumulator: "the front door is now red", "scratch marks on table". Distinguished from StructuralState (closed enum) for queryability — operators ask "is tavern operational?" via StructuralState; LLM ingests drift JSON for descriptive flavor. |
| **ConnectionDecl** | Per-place `Vec<ConnectionDecl>` declaring horizontal edges to other places | DP channel hierarchy gives parent↔child connections implicitly; ConnectionDecl is for HORIZONTAL/non-hierarchy edges (back door of tavern to alley; secret tunnel between two unrelated cells; one-way magical portal). |
| **ConnectionKind** | Closed enum — `Public \| Private \| Locked \| Hidden \| OneWay` | Public = anyone can pass. Private = canonical residents only. Locked = requires key/permit Embedded keyhole (V1: reject with `place.connection_locked`; V1+ key-matching deferred). Hidden = discoverable via Examine; visible only after first discovery. OneWay = enter but not exit (e.g., one-way portal). |
| **EnvObjectSeedDecl** | Fixture-seed declaration owned by Place | `{ seed_uid, envobject_kind, slot_id, default_affordances, initial_state }`. Canonical bootstrap deterministically instantiates EnvObject entities from these seeds. Future EnvObject feature owns the body; PF_001 only declares which fixtures exist where. |
| **EnvObjectKind** | Closed enum — `Door \| Wall \| Table \| Statue \| Fountain \| Bed \| Chest \| Throne \| Altar \| Window \| Sign` | 11 V1 kinds covering common fixture taxonomy. V1+ extensions per future EnvObject feature design. |
| **PlaceDecl** | RealityManifest extension element — see §9 | Author-supplied bootstrap input declaring all V1 places at reality creation. Required: every cell channel must have a PlaceDecl at bootstrap; cells without decl reject `place.missing_decl`. |
| **CanonRef on Place** | `place.canon_ref: BookCanonRef` — book-grounded source | Same canon-ref pattern as NPC_001 / WA_001 — every place anchored to book source unless author-created (then canon_ref = `BookCanonRef::AuthorCreated { reality_id, fiction_time }`). |
| **PlaceTransitionEvent** | The lifecycle envelope for place mutations | Captures structural-state changes + narrative-drift edits + author-edits — emitted as EVT-T3 Derived for state changes; EVT-T8 Administrative for author edits (§2.5). |

---

## §2.5 Event-model mapping (per 07_event_model Option C taxonomy)

PF_001 introduces no new EVT-T* category. Maps onto existing mechanism-level taxonomy:

| PF event | EVT-T* | Sub-type | Producer | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Place birth (canonical seed at RealityManifest bootstrap) | **EVT-T4 System** | `PlaceBorn` | DP-Internal RealityBootstrapper (Synthetic actor) | Emitted alongside cell-channel `MemberJoined` for canonical actors who start at this cell |
| Place runtime spawn (V1+: Forge author creates new place at runtime) | **EVT-T8 Administrative** | `Forge:CreatePlace` | world-service | V1+: Author-edit feature; PF-D7 procedural generation deferred |
| Place structural-state transition (Pristine ↔ Damaged ↔ Destroyed ↔ Restored) | **EVT-T3 Derived** | `aggregate_type=place` (structural_state field delta) | Aggregate-Owner role (world-service post-validate) | Causal-ref to triggering EVT-T1 Submitted (PL_005 Strike Destructive) or EVT-T8 Administrative (Forge edit) |
| Place narrative-drift edit | **EVT-T3 Derived** | `aggregate_type=place` (narrative_drift field delta) | Aggregate-Owner role | Triggered by author-edit OR V1+ in-fiction LLM proposal |
| Author-edit place (rename / change type / update connections / edit fixtures) | **EVT-T8 Administrative** | `Forge:EditPlace { place_id, edit_kind, before, after }` | WA_003 Forge | Audit-grade; same pattern as ForgeEdit for other aggregates |
| Place destruction cascade (Place → Destroyed propagates into embedded EnvObjects + Items at cell) | **EVT-T3 Derived** (multiple `aggregate_type=entity_binding` deltas via EF_001 §6.1) | (multiple) | Aggregate-Owner role | Emitted as a single atomic batch with the place transition; per EF_001 §6.1 cascade contract |
| V1+ scheduled place decay (forest regrowth, market crowd cycle) | **EVT-T5 Generated** | `Scheduled:PlaceDecay` | Future world-rule-scheduler (V1+30d) | Generator framework EVT-G* ready; PF-D3 reserves the slot |

No new EVT-T* row in `_boundaries/01_feature_ownership_matrix.md`. EVT-T4 System sub-types row gains `PlaceBorn` (PF_001-owned alongside EF_001's `EntityBorn`); EVT-T3 Derived sub-types row gains `aggregate_type=place`.

## §3 Aggregate inventory

One aggregate owned by PF_001:

### 3.1 `place` (T2 / Channel-cell scope) — PRIMARY

```rust
#[derive(Aggregate)]
#[dp(type_name = "place", tier = "T2", scope = "channel")]  // bound to cell channel via PlaceId.0 ChannelId
pub struct Place {
    pub place_id: PlaceId,                            // V1: PlaceId(ChannelId) — 1:1 with cell channel
    pub place_type: PlaceType,                        // closed enum (§4)
    pub canon_ref: BookCanonRef,                      // book-grounded source; AuthorCreated for runtime-created (see PF-D12)
    pub display_name: LocalizedName,                  // multi-locale (vi V1; en V1+); see PF-Q3
    pub structural_state: StructuralState,            // closed enum 4-state (§7)
    pub narrative_drift: serde_json::Value,           // freeform per-reality drift; see "Schema policy V1" below
    pub connections: Vec<ConnectionDecl>,             // explicit horizontal edges (§6)
    pub fixture_seed: Vec<EnvObjectSeed>,             // canonical EnvObjects at this place (§8) — materialized form
    pub last_structural_change_fiction_time: FictionTime,
    pub last_narrative_drift_fiction_time: FictionTime,
}

// PlaceId newtype with infallible bidirectional conversion to ChannelId for ergonomic
// hot-path use (Travel resolver / scene-roster / LLM AssemblePrompt avoid `.0` peppering).
// V1+ multi-place-per-cell (PF-D4) would break the strict 1:1; conversion impls would
// be removed at that point.
pub struct PlaceId(pub ChannelId);
impl From<ChannelId> for PlaceId { fn from(c: ChannelId) -> Self { Self(c) } }
impl From<PlaceId> for ChannelId { fn from(p: PlaceId) -> Self { p.0 } }
impl AsRef<ChannelId> for PlaceId { fn as_ref(&self) -> &ChannelId { &self.0 } }

pub struct LocalizedName {
    pub vi: String,                                   // required V1 (project primary locale)
    pub en: Option<String>,                           // V1+ optional
}

pub struct ConnectionDecl {
    pub to_place: PlaceId,
    pub kind: ConnectionKind,                         // §6
    pub bidirectional: bool,                          // V1 hint-only (see §6 traversal rules); does NOT mirror-write the reverse declaration
    pub canon_ref: Option<BookCanonRef>,              // book-grounded path; None for author-added (narrator falls back per §14.2 footnote)
    pub gate_slot_id: Option<String>,                 // for Locked: which fixture-seed slot (e.g., "front_door_keyhole") gates this connection;
                                                      // resolves at write-time to the fixture's computed seed_uid + entity_id
}

// Author-declared shape (lives in PlaceDecl for RealityManifest + Forge edits).
// `slot_id` is the stable position descriptor; `seed_uid` is COMPUTED at materialization
// time (UUID v5 from (reality_id, place_id, slot_id)) — authors never write seed_uids.
pub struct EnvObjectSeedDecl {
    pub envobject_kind: EnvObjectKind,                // closed enum (§2)
    pub slot_id: String,                              // stable position descriptor ("front_door", "main_counter", "fireplace_north_wall")
    pub default_affordances: AffordanceSet,           // EF_001 AffordanceFlag bitset; future EnvObject feature uses for entity_binding override
    pub initial_state: serde_json::Value,             // future EnvObject feature interprets per-kind state schema
}

// Materialized form (lives on the place aggregate). Adds the computed seed_uid alongside
// the author-declared fields. Stored in `place.fixture_seed[]`. Used as the anchor for
// gate_slot_id resolution + entity_id derivation.
pub struct EnvObjectSeed {
    pub seed_uid: SeedUid,                            // computed: UUID v5 from (reality_id, place_id, slot_id) — replay-safe per EVT-A9
    pub envobject_kind: EnvObjectKind,
    pub slot_id: String,
    pub default_affordances: AffordanceSet,
    pub initial_state: serde_json::Value,
}

pub struct SeedUid(pub Uuid);                         // computed; never author-declared
```

**Rules:**
- One row per `place_id` (= one row per cell channel V1). Primary key conflict = `place.duplicate_place`.
- Every cell channel MUST have a `place` row at bootstrap. Cells without place reject runtime ops with `place.missing_decl` (validated at first-use, not at channel creation — channel can exist briefly during bootstrap before place lands).
- Higher-tier channels (continent/country/district/town) MUST NOT have place rows V1. Validated by `place_id.0` resolving to a cell-tier channel per DP channel-tree query.
- `canon_ref` is REQUIRED. Author-created places use `BookCanonRef::AuthorCreated { reality_id, fiction_time, reason }` (PF-D12 watchpoint: BookCanonRef is a shared schema; ownership/registration deferred to future boundary cleanup).
- `connections[].to_place` MUST resolve to existing place row (validated at write); orphan connections reject `place.connection_target_unknown`.
- `connections[].to_place` MUST NOT equal the place's own `place_id` (no self-loops); rejects `place.self_referential_connection`.
- `fixture_seed[].slot_id` MUST be unique within the place's seed list; duplicate slot_ids reject `place.fixture_seed_uid_collision` (rule_id name preserved for namespace stability — collision detected via slot_id since seed_uid is derived).
- `structural_state` transitions follow §7 state machine; forbidden transitions reject `place.invalid_structural_transition`.

**Schema policy V1 — `narrative_drift` freeform JSON:**
- V1 NO server-side schema validation. Authors write whatever JSON; LLM consumes via AssemblePrompt as opaque flavor input.
- V1 NO `narrative_drift_schema_version` field. Migration cost zero (Postgres `JSONB` column accepts any shape).
- V1+30d: per-PlaceType opinionated schemas if profiling shows authors creating unstructured drift that hurts queryability. Versioning per I14 (additive only). Tracked as PF-D12 sibling deferral.
- Consumer guidance V1: features SHOULD treat `narrative_drift` as opaque to LLM; do NOT extract structured fields server-side V1.

## §4 PlaceType closed enum

```rust
pub enum PlaceType {
    Residence,      // private home, apartment, dwelling
    Tavern,         // inn, bar, restaurant, public-meeting commercial
    Marketplace,    // bazaar, shop, trade ground
    Temple,         // religious / spiritual gathering site
    Workshop,       // smith, tailor, alchemist, craft production
    OfficialHall,   // government, court, magistrate, throne room
    Road,           // path, street, highway between places
    Crossroads,     // junction with multiple connections (special routing)
    Wilderness,     // forest, meadow, mountain, generic outdoor
    Cave,           // underground, dungeon precursor
}
```

**Why closed:** compile-time exhaustiveness — every consumer (PL_005 Examine narration, NPC routine scheduler, LLM prompt assembly) MUST handle each PlaceType OR explicitly mark `_ =>`. Catches missing-handler bugs at compile time.

**Per-type defaults V1** (used by Examine narrator + LLM context assembly):

| PlaceType | Default ambient cues | Default fixture-kinds expected | LLM scene-prompt anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Residence | Quiet; private; sparse | Door · Bed · Table · Window | "interior of a private dwelling" |
| Tavern | Lively; smell of food/drink; chatter | Door · Sign (tavern signage) · Table · Wall (for fireplace area) | "interior of a tavern; patrons + staff" |
| Marketplace | Bustling; merchants calling; multi-stall | Sign · Table (stall) · Door (gate) | "open-air market; stalls and traders" |
| Temple | Reverent; incense/candles; quiet voices | Altar · Statue · Door · Window | "religious sanctuary; devotional fixtures" |
| Workshop | Tools clinking; smoke/heat; concentration | Table (workbench) · Wall (tool rack) · Door · Chest | "production workshop; tools and materials" |
| OfficialHall | Formal; echoing; protocol | Throne · Table · Door · Statue | "seat of authority; ceremonial fixtures" |
| Road | Open; weather-exposed; transient | Sign (waypost) · Statue (milestone) | "thoroughfare between locations" |
| Crossroads | Multiple paths visible; landmark | Sign · Statue · Fountain | "junction of multiple paths" |
| Wilderness | Natural; weather; sparse | (sparse — usually no fixtures or only Statue/Sign for landmarks) | "natural outdoor location" |
| Cave | Echoing; damp/cold; limited light | Wall · (rare) Altar / Throne for Lair-type caves | "subterranean space" |

These defaults are HINTS for LLM prompt assembly + scene narration; they don't constrain what fixture_seed CAN declare (a Tavern with a Throne is unusual but valid — author override).

---

## §5 Place ↔ Channel mapping

**V1 strict 1:1 invariant:** every cell-tier channel has exactly one place row; every place row references exactly one cell-tier channel.

```
DP channel tree (cell-tier and below):
  cell:yen_vu_lau          ← place row exists (PlaceId = cell:yen_vu_lau)
  cell:tay_thi_quan        ← place row exists
  cell:hangzhou_market     ← place row exists
```

```
DP channel tree (above cell-tier):
  continent:asia           ← NO place row (aggregation tier)
  country:song_china       ← NO place row
  district:lin_an          ← NO place row
  town:hangzhou            ← NO place row
```

**Why 1:1 V1:** simplest mental model. "What place is X at?" = "what cell channel is X in?" (via EF_001 entity_binding.location.InCell). Multi-place-per-cell (apartment building with multiple internal rooms at same DP channel) is V1+ deferred (PF-D4) — would require sub-place hierarchy + secondary addressing.

**Bootstrap order at RealityManifest ingestion:**
1. DP creates channel hierarchy from `root_channel_tree` (existing PL_001 §16)
2. PF_001 creates `place` rows from `places: Vec<PlaceDecl>` (RealityManifest extension §9)
3. Validation: every cell-tier channel from step 1 has a corresponding place from step 2; mismatch rejects bootstrap with `place.missing_decl` listing offending channel ids
4. EnvObject canonical instantiation: for each place's `fixture_seed`, RealityBootstrapper creates EnvObject entities (deterministic ids via UUID v5 from `(place_id, seed_uid)`) and writes `entity_binding` rows with `location: InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 }` (or `Embedded { parent: <gate_seed_uid envobject>, slot }` for sub-fixtures)
5. NPC + PC canonical seeds (PL_001 §16 + NPC_001) place actors at cells whose place rows are now valid

---

## §6 Connection graph

DP channel hierarchy implicitly provides parent↔child traversal. PF_001 connections add HORIZONTAL edges (peer-to-peer at cell tier, possibly cross-tree).

```rust
pub enum ConnectionKind {
    Public,    // door, road, public path — anyone can pass
    Private,   // canonical residents only — Travel reject for non-residents (V1: residency = canonical_actor home_cell match)
    Locked,    // gated by Embedded fixture (door with keyhole) — V1: reject `place.connection_locked`; V1+ key-matching
    Hidden,    // discoverable via Examine — visible only after `place_discovery` event for this PC (V1+30d; V1: visible to all)
    OneWay,    // enter but not exit — Travel from `to_place` back to source rejects `place.no_reverse_connection`
}
```

**Bidirectional flag — HINT-ONLY V1** (Phase 3 cleanup 2026-04-26 — picks one of two prior-ambiguous interpretations):

`bidirectional: true` is a HINT for traversal: when resolving "can I travel A→B?", consumer code reads BOTH `place(A).connections[]` AND `place(B).connections[]` and treats a `bidirectional: true` ConnectionDecl on either side as evidence of a usable edge. **NO mirror declaration is written** at the reverse end at write-time. Trade-off: 2 reads at hot-path Travel resolution (acceptable per DP-K6 cache); zero mirror-sync invariant to maintain (mirror would risk drift).

`bidirectional: false` requires an explicit reverse declaration on `to_place.connections[]` IF reverse traversal is intended. Used for OneWay portals (no reverse decl exists; reverse Travel rejects `place.no_reverse_connection`) or asymmetric Private (gated one direction).

V1+ optimization (deferred): if profiling shows hot-path read cost is excessive, switch to write-time mirror declaration with explicit invariant maintenance. Tracked at PF-D-Q5 close.

**Travel resolution V1** — entry-point helper consumed by PL_001 §13 travel sequence:

```rust
/// PF_001 connection resolver. PL_001 §13 step ④ calls this to decide whether
/// Travel from current cell to requested destination is permitted, and to recover
/// the canonical narrator hint (canon_ref) for the prose layer.
pub async fn resolve_travel_connection(
    ctx: &SessionContext,
    from_place: PlaceId,
    to_place: PlaceId,
) -> Result<ConnectionDecl, PlaceError>;
```

Resolution algorithm:
1. PC issues `/travel destination=cell:tay_thi_quan` (PL_002 Grammar)
2. PL_001 §13 calls `resolve_travel_connection(ctx, current_place, destination)`
3. Resolver reads `place(current_place).connections[]` for any decl with `to_place == destination`
4. If found AND `kind = Public` → return that ConnectionDecl
5. If found AND `kind = OneWay` (forward) → return ConnectionDecl
6. If found AND `kind = Private` → check residency (V1: canonical_actors[i].initial_cell_path includes current OR destination) → if yes return; else reject `place.connection_private`
7. If found AND `kind = Locked` → V1 always reject `place.connection_locked` (V1+ key-matching deferred per PF-D11)
8. If found AND `kind = Hidden` → V1: visible-to-all, treat as Public; V1+ check per-PC discovered_connections (PF-D10)
9. If NOT found in `from.connections[]`: read `place(destination).connections[]`; for any decl with `to_place == from_place AND bidirectional == true` → treat as reverse-usable per the `bidirectional` HINT; resolve via same kind-matrix (Step 4-8 logic with kind from the FOUND decl)
10. If still not found → reject `place.connection_target_unknown` (no edge in either direction)
11. On accept: ConnectionDecl returned; PL_001 §13 propagates `canon_ref` into Travel narrator text. **If `canon_ref` is None** (author-added connection without book grounding), narrator falls back to `(PlaceType_default_transition_phrase + ConnectionKind_default_phrase)` — e.g., Public + Crossroads → "you walk to the crossroads"; Locked + Cave → not applicable (already rejected). LLM AssemblePrompt receives both endpoint Place contexts so prose can interpolate without canon hint.

**Why explicit V1:** book canon often specifies non-obvious connections (secret tunnel, magical portal). Implicit-only-hierarchy connections would force every Travel through parent-channel routing which is artificial. Explicit Vec<ConnectionDecl> lets author declare canonical paths.

**Transitions (allowed):**

| From → To | Trigger | Owner | reason_kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Pristine` → `Damaged` | PL_005 Strike Destructive (sub-lethal damage) · author-edit (Forge) | PL_005 / WA_003 | `InteractionDestructive` / `Forge:EditPlace` |
| `Damaged` → `Pristine` | author-edit (Forge "repair") · V1+ scheduled regrowth (PF-D3) | WA_003 / scheduler | `Forge:EditPlace` / `ScheduledRegrowth` |
| `Pristine` → `Destroyed` | PL_005 Strike with sufficient cumulative damage · author-edit · V1+ scheduled catastrophe | PL_005 / WA_003 / scheduler | `InteractionDestructive` / `Forge:EditPlace` |
| `Damaged` → `Destroyed` | additional damage; lower threshold than Pristine→Destroyed | PL_005 | `InteractionDestructive` |
| `Destroyed` → `Restored` | author-edit (Forge "rebuild") | WA_003 | `Forge:EditPlace` |
| `Restored` → `Damaged` | new damage post-rebuild | PL_005 | `InteractionDestructive` |
| `Restored` → `Destroyed` | enough new damage | PL_005 | `InteractionDestructive` |

**Forbidden transitions** (validated at write-time; rejected with `place.invalid_structural_transition`):
- `Destroyed` → `Pristine` (must go via Restored to preserve audit precision)
- `Destroyed` → `Damaged` (can't partially un-destroy)
- `Restored` → `Pristine` (Restored is a distinct state; degrades to Damaged or Destroyed only)

**Cascade scope (Phase 3 cleanup 2026-04-26 — explicit):**

Cascade fires **ONLY on transitions ending in `Destroyed`** (i.e., `Pristine → Destroyed`, `Damaged → Destroyed`, `Restored → Destroyed`). Other transitions (`Pristine ↔ Damaged`, `Damaged → Pristine`, `Destroyed → Restored`, `Restored → Damaged`) do NOT auto-propagate to fixtures or cell-resident entities. Each fixture has independent EF_001 lifecycle; if a Pristine tavern transitions to Damaged because of cumulative wall damage, only the wall's lifecycle changed (PL_005 Strike Destructive on the wall) — other fixtures and Items remain unaffected.

This composability rule is intentional: state machines compose at the same severity tier (place-Damaged + fixture-Pristine is a valid joint state representing "tavern has structural issues but fixtures fine"). Coupling damage propagation would create non-local effects that surprise authors.

**Cascade order on `→ Destroyed` (Phase 3 cleanup; replay-determinism per EVT-A9):**

A Place transitioning to `Destroyed` emits the cascade as a **single atomic batch** with deterministic internal step ordering. Atomicity = all steps commit-or-rollback together (Postgres transaction); ordering = events within the batch fire in this fixed sequence:

1. **Place state delta:** EVT-T3 Derived `aggregate_type=place` { structural_state: Destroyed, last_structural_change_fiction_time: now }
2. **PlaceDestroyed cascade-trigger event** (NEW dedicated EVT-T3 sub-shape; see §9 + §2.5 register): EVT-T3 Derived `PlaceDestroyed { place_id, occupants: Vec<EntityId> }` — `occupants` enumerates ALL entities at the cell at trigger-time (PCs / NPCs / Items / EnvObjects), in deterministic sort order by `(entity_type_discriminator_u8, entity_id_uuid_bytes)` for replay-determinism
3. **Consumer cascades fire in occupant-list order:**
    - For each PC occupant: PCS_001 mortality cascade per `mortality_config.unsurvivable_environment` policy (V1 default: `Permadeath` → PC `Existing → Destroyed`)
    - For each NPC occupant: NPC_001 mortality cascade (V1 placeholder: NPC `Existing → Destroyed`; full NPC-mortality V1+30d)
    - Each consumer cascade emits its own EVT-T3 Derived `aggregate_type=entity_binding` deltas with `reason_kind = HolderCascade` per EF_001 §3.2; held items follow EF_001 §6.1 standard "drop to ground" → location InCell(now-destroyed cell)
4. **PF cell-resident cascade:** all EnvObjects with `entity_binding.location ∈ { InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 }, Embedded { parent: <any envobject in this cell> } }` cascade `Existing → Destroyed` (`reason_kind = HolderCascade`); all Items with `location.InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 }` cascade `Existing → Destroyed` (this includes items just-dropped by step 3 PCs/NPCs — captures the surface state at end of step 3)

**Why this order:**
- Step 1+2 (Place + trigger event) MUST come first so consumers can react with full context
- Step 3 (PC/NPC mortality) before step 4 (cell items) so dropped items from dying PCs are captured by the cell-resident cascade — matches "the corpse and everything it dropped are buried under the rubble" intuition
- Deterministic occupant ordering ensures multi-PC scenes destroy PCs in the same order on replay (per EVT-A9)

PCs/NPCs / mortality consumers are NOT silently triggered — they subscribe to the dedicated `PlaceDestroyed` sub-shape. Out-of-scope-for-PF_001 mortality MECHANICS (which damage values trigger PC death etc.) stay with PCS_001 / NPC_001; PF_001 owns only the SIGNAL contract.

**V1+ deferral PF-D3:** scheduled time-decay (forest regrows after fire over fiction-time months; market crowd density cycles diurnally) — Generator framework EVT-G* ready; awaiting feature design.

## §8 Fixture seed model

Place declares its canonical EnvObjects at bootstrap. RealityBootstrapper instantiates EnvObject entities deterministically from the seeds; future EnvObject feature owns the body.

**EnvObjectSeedDecl** (author-declared; lives in PlaceDecl + Forge edit payloads):

```rust
pub struct EnvObjectSeedDecl {
    pub envobject_kind: EnvObjectKind,      // closed enum (Door/Wall/Table/Statue/...)
    pub slot_id: String,                    // stable position descriptor — author choice; e.g., "front_door", "main_counter"
    pub default_affordances: AffordanceSet, // EF_001 AffordanceFlag bitset
    pub initial_state: serde_json::Value,   // future EnvObject feature interprets
}
```

**EnvObjectSeed** (materialized; lives on `place.fixture_seed[]` post-write):

```rust
pub struct EnvObjectSeed {
    pub seed_uid: SeedUid,                  // COMPUTED by world-service: UUID v5 from (reality_id, place_id, slot_id)
    pub envobject_kind: EnvObjectKind,
    pub slot_id: String,
    pub default_affordances: AffordanceSet,
    pub initial_state: serde_json::Value,
}

pub struct SeedUid(pub Uuid);  // never author-declared

pub enum EnvObjectKind {
    Door,       // gateway between cells; can be Locked
    Wall,       // boundary; usually non-interactive but Examine target
    Table,      // surface; supports Items via V1+ container affordance
    Statue,     // landmark; often book-canon-grounded for Examine flavor
    Fountain,   // water feature; flavor + V1+ Use (drink/bathe)
    Bed,        // residence fixture; rest/sleep affordance V1+
    Chest,      // V1+ container (PF-D-via-EF-D3 dependency)
    Throne,     // OfficialHall fixture; ceremonial
    Altar,      // Temple fixture; ritual focus
    Window,     // boundary; visible-from-outside V1+
    Sign,       // text-bearing; Examine returns sign content
}
```

**Canonical instantiation flow (at RealityManifest bootstrap):**
1. For each place, iterate author-declared `fixture_seed: Vec<EnvObjectSeedDecl>` from PlaceDecl
2. For each EnvObjectSeedDecl: world-service **computes** `seed_uid = UUID v5(reality_id, place_id, slot_id)` and materializes `EnvObjectSeed` (SeedDecl + computed seed_uid) into `place.fixture_seed[]`
3. For each materialized seed: deterministic EnvObjectId = UUID v5 `(reality_id, place_id, seed_uid)` — same reality clone produces same EnvObjectIds (replay-safe per EVT-A9; double-hash because seed_uid is itself UUID v5)
4. Write `entity_binding` row per EF_001 §3.1: `{ entity_id: EnvObject(...), entity_type: EnvObject, location: InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 }, lifecycle_state: Existing, affordance_overrides: Some(seed.default_affordances), ... }`
5. Future EnvObject feature owns body row (deferred V1; binding alone covers Examine + connection-gating V1)
6. Emit EVT-T4 System `EntityBorn { entity_id, entity_type: EnvObject, cell_id, reason_kind: CanonicalSeed }` per EF_001 §13.1 sequence

**Connection gate resolution** (when ConnectionDecl has `gate_slot_id: Some(...)`): at write-time, world-service resolves `gate_slot_id` against `place.fixture_seed[]` to find matching `EnvObjectSeed.slot_id`; the matched seed's `seed_uid` + derived `entity_id` becomes the gate fixture reference. Failure to match → `place.connection_gate_unresolved` (V1+ rule_id reservation; V1 trips `place.connection_target_unknown` since gate_slot_id is part of connection validation).

**Affordance defaults by EnvObjectKind** (V1; future EnvObject feature may extend):

| EnvObjectKind | Default AffordanceSet V1 | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Door | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use door" = open/close; Locked variant adds gate flag |
| Wall | `BeExamined` | passive-only |
| Table | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use table" = sit/place item (V1+ container) |
| Statue | `BeExamined` | passive landmark |
| Fountain | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use fountain" = drink/bathe (V1+ effects) |
| Bed | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use bed" = rest/sleep (V1+ status effects) |
| Chest | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use chest" = open/close; V1+ container |
| Throne | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use throne" = sit (status effect: PerceivedAuthority V1+) |
| Altar | `BeExamined + BeUsed` | "Use altar" = ritual (V1+ Temple-bound) |
| Window | `BeExamined` | view-only V1; V1+ climb-through |
| Sign | `BeExamined` | examine returns text content from `initial_state` |

Per-instance overrides via `entity_binding.affordance_overrides` (e.g., a magical talking statue gains `BeSpokenTo`).

## §9 RealityManifest extension + `place.*` RejectReason namespace

**Extension to RealityManifest** (per `_boundaries/02_extension_contracts.md` §2):

```rust
pub struct RealityManifest {
    // ... existing Continuum-owned + WA + NPC fields ...

    // ─── PF_001 Place Foundation extension (added 2026-04-26) ───
    pub places: Vec<PlaceDecl>,           // REQUIRED V1; one per cell-tier channel
}

pub struct PlaceDecl {
    pub place_id: PlaceId,                // = cell ChannelId
    pub place_type: PlaceType,
    pub canon_ref: BookCanonRef,
    pub display_name: LocalizedName,
    pub initial_structural_state: StructuralState,  // typically Pristine; book-canonical override possible
    pub initial_narrative_drift: serde_json::Value, // typically {} at canonical seed
    pub connections: Vec<ConnectionDecl>,
    pub fixture_seed: Vec<EnvObjectSeedDecl>,       // author-declared form (no seed_uid; world-service computes)
}
```

**EVT-T3 Derived sub-shape `PlaceDestroyed`** (Phase 3 cleanup 2026-04-26 — dedicated cascade-trigger event):

```rust
// Emitted by PF_001 immediately after a place's structural-state delta when transitioning
// to Destroyed (per §7 cascade order step 2). Subscribers (PCS_001 / NPC_001 / Items / future
// quest-engine) react by triggering their own per-entity cascades. Out-of-scope-for-PF_001
// mortality MECHANICS stay with consumer features; PF_001 owns only the SIGNAL contract.
pub struct PlaceDestroyed {
    pub place_id: PlaceId,
    pub occupants: Vec<EntityId>,         // ALL entities at cell at trigger time, sorted deterministically
                                          // by (entity_type_discriminator_u8, entity_id_uuid_bytes) for replay-determinism
    pub trigger_reason: PlaceDestructionReason,
    pub fiction_time: FictionTime,
}

pub enum PlaceDestructionReason {
    InteractionDestructive,               // PL_005 Strike Destructive cumulative damage
    AdminEdit,                            // WA_003 Forge:EditPlace setting structural_state = Destroyed
    ScheduledCatastrophe,                 // V1+30d scheduled decay event
    NarrativeCanonization,                // V1+ canon-update changes place state
}
```

**`place.*` RejectReason namespace V1** (owned by PF_001; registered in `_boundaries/02_extension_contracts.md` §1.4):

| rule_id | Trigger | Vietnamese reject copy V1 | Soft-override eligible |
|---|---|---|---|
| `place.missing_decl` | cell-tier channel exists without `place` row at runtime | "Vị trí chưa được định nghĩa." | No (bootstrap invariant) |
| `place.duplicate_place` | second write attempt for `place_id` that already has a row | "Vị trí này đã được đăng ký." | No (write-time invariant) |
| `place.invalid_structural_transition` | aggregate-owner attempts forbidden transition (§7) | "Chuyển đổi trạng thái cấu trúc không hợp lệ." | No (write-time validator) |
| `place.unknown_place` | `PlaceId` resolves to no `place` row | "Không tìm thấy vị trí." | No (always reject) |
| `place.connection_target_unknown` | ConnectionDecl `to_place` references non-existent place | "Đích kết nối không tồn tại." | No (write-time validator) |
| `place.connection_locked` | Travel attempt through Locked connection without satisfying gate (V1: always reject; V1+ key-matching) | "Lối đi đã khoá." | No (V1; soft-override may activate V1+ if Examine-the-lock is needed) |
| `place.connection_private` | Travel attempt through Private connection without canonical residency match | "Lối đi riêng tư, không được phép." | No |
| `place.connection_hidden` | Travel attempt through undiscovered Hidden connection (V1: visible to all so does not fire; V1+30d when discovery flags land) | "Không nhìn thấy lối đi nào ở đây." | Yes (Examine-the-area can hint per V1+ discovery feature) |
| `place.no_reverse_connection` | Travel attempt to reverse a OneWay connection | "Không thể quay lại đường này." | No |
| `place.fixture_seed_uid_collision` | duplicate `slot_id` in same place's fixture_seed list (rule_id name preserved for namespace stability; collision detected via slot_id since seed_uid is computed) | "Trùng định danh thiết bị nội thất." | No (bootstrap invariant) |
| `place.invalid_place_type_for_channel_tier` | place row attempted on non-cell-tier channel (continent/country/district/town) | "Loại kênh không hợp lệ cho vị trí." | No (V1 cell-only invariant) |
| `place.self_referential_connection` | ConnectionDecl `to_place == place.place_id` (self-loop); validated at write-time | "Kết nối không thể trỏ về chính nó." | No (write-time invariant) |

**V1+ rule_id reservations** (additive per I14):
- `place.scheduled_decay_collision` — V1+30d scheduler conflict on same place
- `place.cross_reality_connection` — V1+ multiverse portal connection between realities (PF-D6)
- `place.procedural_generation_rejected` — V1+ Forge author-review rejects LLM-proposed place (PF-D7)
- `place.connection_gate_unresolved` — V1+ stricter gate validation: gate_slot_id matches no fixture_seed entry at the place; V1 collapses into `place.connection_target_unknown` since gate is part of connection validation

---

## §10 DP primitives consumed

PF_001 implements one aggregate against the locked DP contract; no new primitives needed.

| DP primitive | Used for | Pattern |
|---|---|---|
| `t2_read(place, key=place_id)` | look up place semantics + structural state + connections + fixtures | Hot-path for Examine + Travel; cached per DP-K6 subscribe |
| `t2_write(place, key=place_id, mutation)` | structural state transition · narrative drift edit · author-edit | Aggregate-Owner role per DP-K5 |
| `subscribe(place, filter)` | UI invalidation on place change; LLM context refresh; PL_005c cascade hooks | DP-K6 durable subscribe |
| `t2_scan(place, filter)` | rare admin queries (find all places of type X) | NOT hot-path; admin/audit only — DP-A8 |

**No new DP-K* primitives requested.** PF_001 fits within existing kernel surface.

---

## §11 Capability JWT claims

PF_001 declares no new top-level capability claim. Reuses existing claims:

- `produce: ["AggregateMutation", "AdminAction"]` — required to write `place` aggregate + Forge admin edits (already present for world-service)
- Per-aggregate write capability under `capabilities[]` per DP-K9 — needs `place:write`

**Service binding:** world-service is the canonical writer for `place`. Aggregate handoff between world-service nodes follows PL_001 §3.6 epoch-fence model unchanged (places are channel-bound; channel writer-binding extends naturally).

---

## §12 Subscribe pattern

UI invalidation + downstream feature consumption via DP-K6 subscribe.

**Subscribers V1:**

| Subscriber | Filter | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend (player UI) | `place WHERE place_id = current_cell.place_id` | scene description display; auto-refresh on structural state change |
| LLM prompt assembly (`AssemblePrompt`) | same | `[PLACE_CONTEXT]` section in prompt: place_type + canon_ref content + structural_state + narrative_drift |
| PL_005c Interaction integration | `place WHERE place_id ∈ examine.targets` | Examine of place returns combined narrator text |
| WA_003 Forge author UI | `place WHERE reality_id = current` | author scene editor; shows places hierarchy |
| Future quest-engine | `place` | quest triggers on PlaceType / structural state |

**Validator slot considerations:** EVT-V_place_structural runs as part of PL_005's structural-affordance check (`EVT-V_entity_affordance` at EF_001 §11) — when target is a place via PL_005 ExamineTarget::Place, this validator confirms place exists + structural_state allows examine. Slot ordering deferred to `_boundaries/03_validator_pipeline_slots.md` alignment review (PF-Q1 watchpoint).

---

## §13 Cross-service handoff

PlaceId is just a newtype over ChannelId, so cross-service serialization reuses existing channel-id JSON shape:

```json
{ "place_id": { "channel_id": "cell:yen_vu_lau" } }
```

Causality token chain unchanged: place mutations include CausalityToken referencing the triggering EVT-T1 Submitted (or EVT-T8 Administrative for Forge edits). Replay-determinism preserved per EVT-A9.

---

## §14 Sequences (5 V1 representative flows)

### 14.1 Canonical place birth at RealityManifest bootstrap

```
RealityManifest.places[i] = PlaceDecl { place_id: cell:yen_vu_lau, place_type: Tavern, ... }
  ↓ (bootstrap step 2 per §5)
RealityBootstrapper emits EVT-T4 System PlaceBorn { place_id, place_type, parent_channel: town:hangzhou }
  ↓ (atomic with bootstrap transaction)
write place row { place_id: cell:yen_vu_lau, place_type: Tavern, structural_state: Pristine, ... }
  ↓ (bootstrap step 4)
For each fixture_seed[i]: deterministic EnvObjectId via UUID v5; write entity_binding row per EF_001 §13.1
emit EVT-T4 System EntityBorn (per fixture) — these are cascaded with PlaceBorn in the same atomic batch
```

### 14.2 Travel through public connection (PL_002 /travel)

```
PC at cell:yen_vu_lau issues /travel destination=cell:tay_thi_quan
  ↓ EVT-T1 Submitted PCTurn { kind: Travel, destination: cell:tay_thi_quan }
PL_001 §13 travel sequence calls PF_001 connection-resolver:
  - read place row for cell:yen_vu_lau
  - check connections[]: any with to_place=cell:tay_thi_quan?
    → found: ConnectionDecl { to_place: cell:tay_thi_quan, kind: Public, bidirectional: true, canon_ref: <book_chapter_4_path> }
  - kind=Public → pass; canon_ref propagates into Travel narrator
  → resolved
  ↓ PL_001 §13 travel proceeds: t2_write entity_binding (EntityId::Pc) location InCell(cell:tay_thi_quan)
DP emits MemberLeft(yen_vu_lau) + MemberJoined(tay_thi_quan); narrator includes book-canonical path description
```

### 14.3 In-fiction structural transition via PL_005 Strike Destructive

```
PC issues Interaction.Strike { target: EnvObject(stone_wall_north), tool: Item(war_hammer), damage: HighDestructive }
  ↓ EVT-T1 Submitted Interaction:Strike commits
PL_005c integration cascade (per its §V1-scope):
  - EnvObject(stone_wall_north) lifecycle Existing → Destroyed (EF_001 §6.1)
  - PF_001 cascade hook: place row for cell containing wall checks structural_state
    → Pristine + significant fixture destroyed → transition Pristine → Damaged
    → emit EVT-T3 Derived { aggregate_type: place, delta: { structural_state: Damaged, last_structural_change_fiction_time: now } }
  - reason_kind=InteractionDestructive; causal_ref=<strike_event>
LLM next-turn AssemblePrompt includes updated structural_state + narrative_drift hint
```

### 14.4 PL_005 Examine of place (ExamineTarget::Place)

```
PC issues Interaction.Examine { target: ExamineTarget::Place(cell:yen_vu_lau) }
  ↓ EVT-T1 Submitted Interaction:Examine commits (Examine has no destructive output; pure perception)
PF_001 EVT-V_place_structural validator (ordered before per-kind):
  - place exists? ✓
  - structural_state ∈ {Pristine, Damaged, Restored}? ✓ (Destroyed soft-overrides per EF_001 §8 tolerates_destroyed)
PL_005 Examine narrator combines:
  - place.canon_ref content (book description chunk)
  - place.structural_state hint ("the tavern is in good repair" / "scratched up" / "burnt-out shell")
  - place.narrative_drift JSON (per-reality flavor)
  - PL_001 scene_state ambient (weather, crowd, time-of-day)
  - visible EnvObjects at cell (entity_binding query) with their default_affordances names
LLM produces narrator_text combining all
```

### 14.5 Author-edit place via Forge (WA_003)

```
Author issues Forge:EditPlace { place_id: cell:yen_vu_lau, edit_kind: UpdateNarrativeDrift, before: {...}, after: {"front_door_color": "red"} }
  ↓ EVT-T8 Administrative Forge:EditPlace commits
WA_003 Forge writes:
  - t2_write place: narrative_drift = after; last_narrative_drift_fiction_time = now
  - emit EVT-T3 Derived { aggregate_type: place, delta: { narrative_drift: ... } }
  - emit ForgeEdit audit log (forge_audit_log per WA_003)
LLM next-turn AssemblePrompt sees updated drift; players in cell observe changed scene description
```

## §15 Acceptance criteria

10 V1-testable scenarios (AC-PF-1..10):

1. **AC-PF-1 — RealityManifest places extension required:** RealityManifest with `places: []` (empty) but cell-tier channels declared in `root_channel_tree` rejects bootstrap with `place.missing_decl { offending_channels: [...] }`. Tests §5 invariant + §9 bootstrap order.
2. **AC-PF-2 — Cell-tier 1:1 invariant:** RealityManifest with `places[i].place_id = town:hangzhou` (non-cell-tier channel) rejects bootstrap with `place.invalid_place_type_for_channel_tier`. Tests §5.
3. **AC-PF-3 — PlaceType variant exhaustiveness (compile-time):** Rust unit test that uses `match place_type` without arms for all 10 V1 variants fails to compile with `error[E0004]: non-exhaustive patterns`. CI lint (unified across all closed-enum exhaustiveness ACs — see EF_001 AC-EF-1 + future closed-enum features) flags `_ =>` arms outside designated catch-all sites with `// CLOSED-ENUM-EXEMPT: <reason>` annotation. Annotation namespace is repo-wide (NOT feature-prefixed) since multiple closed enums share the same exhaustiveness discipline; per-feature prefixes would fragment the convention as new closed enums are added (StatusFlag / RoleKind / LexConfigKind / etc.).
4. **AC-PF-4 — Forbidden StructuralState transitions reject:** attempting `Destroyed → Pristine` (or `Destroyed → Damaged` or `Restored → Pristine`) rejects `place.invalid_structural_transition`. Tests §7.
5. **AC-PF-5 — Connection target validation:** writing place row with `connections[i].to_place` pointing to non-existent PlaceId rejects `place.connection_target_unknown`. Bootstrap-time validation; runtime author-edit also validates.
6. **AC-PF-6 — Locked connection blocks Travel V1:** PC at place A attempts /travel to place B via ConnectionKind::Locked → reject `place.connection_locked` (V1 always; V1+ key-matching deferred).
7. **AC-PF-7 — Place destruction cascade ordering (Phase 3 4-step contract):** Place transition `Pristine → Destroyed` (or `Damaged → Destroyed` or `Restored → Destroyed`) emits a single atomic batch (Postgres transaction; commit-or-rollback together) with deterministic 4-step internal ordering:
    - **Step 1**: EVT-T3 Derived `aggregate_type=place` delta `{ structural_state: Destroyed, last_structural_change_fiction_time: now }`
    - **Step 2**: EVT-T3 Derived dedicated `PlaceDestroyed { place_id, occupants, trigger_reason, fiction_time }` cascade-trigger sub-shape; `occupants` enumerates ALL entities at cell at trigger-time sorted by `(entity_type_discriminator_u8, entity_id_uuid_bytes)` (replay-determinism per EVT-A9)
    - **Step 3** (consumer cascades — for each occupant in occupant-list order): PCs cascade per PCS_001 mortality (V1: `Destroyed`); NPCs cascade per NPC_001 mortality (V1 placeholder: `Destroyed`); held items drop to InCell(now-destroyed cell) per EF_001 §6.1 standard "drop to ground"; each consumer emits its own EVT-T3 `aggregate_type=entity_binding` deltas with `reason_kind = HolderCascade`
    - **Step 4** (PF cell-resident cascade — last): all EnvObjects with `entity_binding.location ∈ { InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 }, Embedded { parent: <cell envobject> } }` cascade `Existing → Destroyed`; all Items with `location.InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 }` (including just-dropped items from step 3) cascade `Existing → Destroyed`; both with `reason_kind = HolderCascade`
    No intermediate state observable to readers in same reality. Test setup: SPIKE_01-style cell with 1 PC + 1 NPC + 1 Item-on-table + 1 Door (EnvObject) + author triggers Forge:EditPlace setting structural_state=Destroyed; verify event-log shows steps 1-4 in order with deterministic occupant sort. Tests §7 cascade contract + §3.2 EF_001 reason_kinds.
8. **AC-PF-8 — Forge:EditPlace atomicity (3-write transaction):** Forge:EditPlace executes 3 writes within a single Postgres transaction: (a) update `place` row, (b) emit EVT-T8 Administrative `Forge:EditPlace { place_id, edit_kind, before, after }` to event log, (c) append to `forge_audit_log` (WA_003-owned aggregate). Either all 3 commit or all 3 rollback (no partial state). Test setup: spawn Forge author session, issue EditPlace, then issue read for (place row, last EVT-T8 in log, last forge_audit_log entry); all three reflect the new state. Negative test: induce failure between (a) and (b) (e.g., Postgres connection drop mid-transaction); verify NEITHER (a) nor (b) nor (c) committed. Tests §14.5 sequence + WA_003 forge_audit_log integration.
9. **AC-PF-9 — PL_005 Examine of place returns combined narrator (cross-feature dep on PL_005 ExamineTarget extension):** Examine target `ExamineTarget::Place(cell:yen_vu_lau)` (PL_005 InteractionKind extension PER PF-Q4 watchpoint — PL_005 closure pass must add `ExamineTarget = Entity(EntityId) | Place(PlaceId)` discriminator before this AC can pass) returns narrator text containing 4 components:
    - (a) `place.canon_ref` content reference (knowledge-service lookup OR `BookCanonRef::AuthorCreated` flavor placeholder)
    - (b) `place.structural_state` hint mapped to phrase ("the tavern is in good repair" / "scratched up" / "burnt-out shell" / "rebuilt to former glory")
    - (c) at-least-one EnvObject reference from `entity_binding WHERE location.InCell { cell_id: place_id.0 } AND lifecycle_state = Existing`, identified by `EntityKind::display_name + AffordanceFlag` summary
    - (d) PL_001 `scene_state` ambient cue (weather + time-of-day + crowd_density)
    All four components present (no "ERROR: missing X") means LLM has full context for narration. Verification: LLM unit test asserts narrator text contains substrings matching each component category. Cross-feature blocker: AC cannot run V1 until PL_005 `ExamineTarget` extension lands. Tests §12 subscribe pattern + §14.4 sequence.
10. **AC-PF-10 — Fixture seed deterministic instantiation (Phase 3 computed-seed model):** Author writes PlaceDecl with `fixture_seed: Vec<EnvObjectSeedDecl>` where each entry has `slot_id: String` (no seed_uid — author never declares it). At materialization, world-service computes per fixture: `seed_uid = UUID v5(reality_id, place_id, slot_id)` AND `entity_id = EnvObject(UUID v5(reality_id, place_id, seed_uid))`. Two reality clones from same RealityManifest produce IDENTICAL `seed_uid` AND `entity_id` for each fixture (deterministic; replay-safe per EVT-A9). Test: clone reality A → reality B at fiction_time T; for fixture at slot "front_door" of cell `yen_vu_lau`: assert `reality_a.fixture("yen_vu_lau", "front_door").seed_uid == reality_b.fixture(...).seed_uid` AND `same for entity_id`. Negative test: changing `slot_id` produces different `seed_uid` (slot_id is the discriminator). Tests §3.1 + §8 fixture-seed materialization flow.

## §16 Deferrals

| ID | What | Why deferred | Target phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PF-D1** | V1+ PlaceType extensions (Dungeon / Battlefield / Vehicle / ShipDeck / DreamRealm) | Not V1-blocking; additive per I14 | When first such genre feature designed |
| **PF-D2** | V1+ ConnectionKind extensions (TimePortal / PocketDimension / Resonance) | V1+ supernatural travel kinds | V1+ supernatural feature design |
| **PF-D3** | V1+30d scheduled place decay (forest regrowth, market crowd cycle) | Generator framework EVT-G* ready; no V1 use case has named cadence | V1+30d scheduler design |
| **PF-D4** | Multi-place per cell (apartment building with multiple internal rooms at same DP channel) | adds sub-place hierarchy + secondary addressing complexity; V1 strict 1:1 covers covers SPIKE_01 + most book-canon scenarios | V1+ if author content needs |
| **PF-D5** | Place-level Heresy contamination rules (currently per-actor only per WA_002) | V1: contamination is per-(actor, kind). V1+: places themselves can become contaminated (e.g., a temple becomes heretical) | V1+ Heresy expansion |
| **PF-D6** | Cross-reality place references (multiverse portal between two realities) | V2+ multiverse expansion; current `cross_reality_reference` reservation in `entity.*` namespace | V2+ |
| **PF-D7** | Procedural place generation (LLM-suggested places with author-review gate) | V1+ Forge author workflow + EVT-T6 Proposal generator | Future Forge V2 |
| **PF-D8** | Place-level audio/visual asset references for V1+ rendering | V1: text-only narration. V1+ multimedia rendering layer hooks | V1+ frontend rendering V2 |
| **PF-D9** | Place-level economy (Marketplace pricing, Workshop crafting tables) | V1: places have type + state but no economic semantics | V1+ economy feature |
| **PF-D10** | Hidden connection discovery flags (per-PC discovered_connections set) | V1: Hidden connections visible to all (effectively Public). V1+ per-PC progress + discovery via Examine | V1+30d quest/exploration |
| **PF-D11** | V1+ container EnvObject affordance (BeContainedIn) cross-reference | requires EF_001 EF-D3; PF_001 declares EnvObjectKind::Chest with placeholder affordance V1 | Future Item + EnvObject features |
| **PF-D12** | `BookCanonRef` shared-schema registration in `_boundaries/02_extension_contracts.md` | `BookCanonRef::AuthorCreated` variant used by PF_001 + PCS_001 (when designed) + WA_003 Forge + NPC_001 author-NPCs; envelope owner unspecified; should land alongside future IF_001 RealityManifest infrastructure feature | Future boundary cleanup pass / IF_001 design |
| **PF-D13** | `narrative_drift` per-PlaceType opinionated schemas with versioning | V1 freeform JSONB; profile V1+30d; if authors create unstructured drift hurting LLM context coherency or operator queryability, introduce per-type schemas with monotonic versioning per I14 | V1+30d profiling + author UX review |
| **PF-D14** | Bidirectional flag write-time mirror declaration optimization | V1 hint-only (2 reads at Travel hot-path); V1+ if profiling shows pain, switch to write-time mirror with maintained invariant | V1+30d profiling |

## §17 Cross-references

- **PL_001 Continuum** §16 — RealityManifest extended with `places: Vec<PlaceDecl>` (this commit; light reopen). PL_001 §3.2 scene_state stays under PL_001 ownership; runtime ambient is play-loop concern. PL_001 §3.2 `notable_props` semantics light-clarified: V1 freeform strings still supported; V1+ may reference EnvObjectIds for addressable fixtures.
- **EF_001 Entity Foundation** §6.1 — Place destruction cascade integrates with EF_001 cascade rules; PF_001 owns the trigger (StructuralState → Destroyed) and EF_001 owns the per-entity propagation (HolderCascade reason_kind).
- **EF_001 §3.1** — `entity_binding.location.InCell { cell_id }` cross-references PlaceId via `cell_id == place_id.0` invariant; EnvObject fixtures bind via `Embedded { parent: <gate envobject>, slot }` for sub-fixtures.
- **PL_002 Grammar** §V1-commands — `/travel destination=<cell_id>` consumes PF_001 connection-resolver. Travel rejects map to `place.connection_*` rule_ids.
- **PL_005 Interaction** §V1-kinds — Examine kind extended with `ExamineTarget = Entity(EntityId) | Place(PlaceId)` discriminator (cross-feature dependency on PL_005 still DRAFT; PL_005 closure-pass should add this extension).
- **PL_005c Interaction integration** §V1-scope — Strike Destructive cascade includes PF_001 hook for place structural-state transition.
- **PL_006 Status Effects** — places do NOT have actor_status V1 (only PC+NPC do; V1+ if "the temple is blessed/cursed" status needed, that's PF-D5 expansion not PL_006 expansion).
- **NPC_001 Cast** — `npc.current_region_id: ChannelId` cross-references the cell-tier channel hosting the NPC; EF-Q2 watchpoint (npc.current_region_id may migrate to entity_binding) compatible with PF_001 1:1 mapping.
- **NPC_002 Chorus** — scene-roster context for NPC_002 reaction batching gains place_type + structural_state hints; NPC behavior may diverge by PlaceType (NPC in Tavern more talkative; NPC in Wilderness more cautious).
- **PCS_001** (when designed) — PC spawn cell MUST reference valid PlaceId (canonical place row exists). Brief at `features/06_pc_systems/00_AGENT_BRIEF.md` requires update post PF_001 LOCK to add §4.4d mandatory PF_001 reading.
- **WA_001 Lex** — Lex axioms can reference PlaceType (e.g., "magic strength varies by place: Wilderness +20%, Cave +10%, Temple −10%"); V1+ if needed; PF_001 provides the queryable PlaceType enum.
- **WA_002 Heresy** — V1+ place-level contamination per PF-D5.
- **WA_003 Forge** — Forge:EditPlace AdminAction registered (§2.5 + §14.5).
- **07_event_model** — EVT-T4 System sub-type `PlaceBorn` + EVT-T3 Derived `aggregate_type=place` registered.
- **06_data_plane** — `place` aggregate sits in T2/Channel-cell scope per existing DP contract. No new primitives.
- **03_multiverse (MV12)** — fiction-time advancement triggers V1+ scheduled decay (PF-D3); current V1 time-lapse via author-edit + in-fiction event only.

- [x] RealityManifest extension `places: Vec<PlaceDecl>` (registered in `_boundaries/02_extension_contracts.md` §2)
- [x] Reference safety policy: **12 V1 rule_ids** in `place.*` namespace (Phase 3 cleanup added `place.self_referential_connection`) + 4 V1+ reservations (added `place.connection_gate_unresolved`)
- [x] Event-model mapping: EVT-T3 Derived (`aggregate_type=place` + dedicated `PlaceDestroyed` cascade-trigger sub-shape Phase 3 cleanup) + EVT-T4 System (`PlaceBorn`) + EVT-T8 Administrative (`Forge:EditPlace`); no new EVT-T*
- [x] DP primitives: existing surface only (no new DP-K*)
- [x] Capability JWT: existing claims (no new top-level)
- [x] Subscribe pattern: 5 subscribers V1 (Frontend / LLM AssemblePrompt / PL_005c / WA_003 / future quest-engine); cascade-trigger consumers (PCS_001 / NPC_001) subscribe to dedicated `PlaceDestroyed` sub-shape
- [x] Cross-service handoff: PlaceId JSON shape (newtype over ChannelId)
- [x] 5 representative sequences
- [x] 10 V1-testable acceptance scenarios (AC-PF-1..10); CLOSED-ENUM-EXEMPT annotation unified with EF_001 (Phase 3 cleanup)

- [x] Cross-references to all 13 affected features + foundation docs
- [x] Phase 3 review cleanup applied 2026-04-26 (Severity 1 + 2 + 3 — PlaceId From/Into ergonomics; SeedUid computed-vs-declared split + author EnvObjectSeedDecl drops seed_uid; gate_seed_uid → gate_slot_id author-friendly; cascade-only-on-Destroyed rule explicit; bidirectional hint-only V1; lazy-cell derivation policy explicit (PL_001b §16.3); place.self_referential_connection added; PlaceDestroyed dedicated EVT-T3 sub-shape with occupants list; cascade ordering specified; Sign-as-Door typo fix; narrative_drift schema policy V1 documented; CLOSED-ENUM-EXEMPT unified annotation; travel-connection-resolver helper signature; canon_ref None narrator fallback)
- [x] Closure-pass walk-through 2026-04-26 — §15 acceptance criteria walked AC-PF-1..10; **0 rule_id mismatches** (Phase 3 caught those proactively, unlike EF_001 which discovered 3 missing); 4 ACs (AC-PF-7 / AC-PF-8 / AC-PF-9 / AC-PF-10) precision-tightened to reflect Phase 3 contract changes (cascade 4-step ordering + PlaceDestroyed signal · 3-write transaction atomicity scope · PL_005 ExamineTarget cross-feature blocker explicit · seed_uid computed-not-declared model); 6 V1 rule_ids without standalone ACs (`duplicate_place` / `unknown_place` / `connection_private` / `connection_hidden` / `no_reverse_connection` / `fixture_seed_uid_collision` / `self_referential_connection`) covered implicitly via integration tests — same pattern as EF_001 closure pass
- [x] **CANDIDATE-LOCK 2026-04-26** — boundary matrix `place` row updated · extension contracts §1.4 entity.* count updated · _index.md status promoted · changelog appended. Downstream updates (PCS_001 brief §4.4d / PL_005 ExamineTarget extension) tracked at consumer-feature design time

## §19 Open questions (post-DRAFT)

| ID | Question | Resolution path |
|---|---|---|
| **PF-Q1** | Validator slot ordering: EVT-V_place_structural relative to EVT-V_entity_affordance + EVT-V_lex? Place check is structural like entity check; should they be the same slot or sequential? | `_boundaries/03_validator_pipeline_slots.md` alignment review (extends EF-Q3 from EF_001) |
| **PF-Q2** | Should `place.canon_ref` be required for AuthorCreated places (current spec uses `BookCanonRef::AuthorCreated`) or optional? | V1: required as `AuthorCreated` variant; if author resists author-creation friction, V1+ make optional with fallback to reality-default canon_ref |
| **PF-Q3** | Multi-locale `display_name` — V1 only `vi`, but PL_001 LocalizedName pattern not yet established. Should LocalizedName live in PF_001, EF_001, or a shared 00_foundation layer? | Boundary review V1+ when `en` locale lands (probably 00_foundation for cross-cutting) |
| **PF-Q4** | Should Place be addressable as 5th EntityId variant (Pc/Npc/Item/EnvObject/Place) instead of separate ExamineTarget discriminator? Trade-off: EntityId extension is invasive across all entity machinery; ExamineTarget is local to PL_005 | V1: separate ExamineTarget — places are containers not things; reconsider V1+ if Place ends up being struck/used (currently no V1 use case beyond Examine) |
| **PF-Q5** | Connection bidirectional default — should bidirectional default to true (most paths are two-way) to reduce author-decl burden, or false for safety? | V1: default true; explicit false for OneWay/asymmetric — matches book-canon expectation |
