## 2026-04-25 — Folder seeded

- **Lock claim:** main session 2026-04-25 (Claude Opus 4.7) at 2026-04-25
- **Files created:**
  - `_LOCK.md` (single-writer mutex)
  - `00_README.md` (purpose, rules, how-to-use)
  - `01_feature_ownership_matrix.md` (initial entries for 11 designed features: PL_001/001b/002, NPC_001/002, WA_001..006)
  - `02_extension_contracts.md` (TurnEvent envelope §1, RealityManifest §2, capability JWT §3, EVT-T8 sub-shapes §4)
  - `03_validator_pipeline_slots.md` (proposed EVT-V* ordering pending event-model Phase 3 lock)
  - `99_changelog.md` (this file)
- **Initial drift watchpoints captured (8):** GR-D8, CST-D1, LX-D5, HER-D8, HER-D9, CHR-D9, WA_006 over-extension, B2 RealityManifest envelope
- **Reason:** post-WA_006 boundary review (2026-04-25) revealed boundary issues across the 11 features designed in one work session; a mutex'd boundary folder is the long-term fix
- **Lock release:** at end of seeding commit
