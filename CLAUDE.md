# CLAUDE.md — LoreWeave Development Guide

## What This Project Is

LoreWeave is a multi-agent platform for multilingual novel workflows (translation, analysis, knowledge building, assisted creation). Self-hosted, Docker Compose-based monorepo.

Source of truth for current status: `docs/sessions/SESSION_PATCH.md`

---

## Architecture

Monorepo layout:
- `services/` — microservices (Go/Chi, Python/FastAPI, TypeScript/NestJS)
- `frontend/` — Vite + React + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- `contracts/api/` — OpenAPI specs per service domain
- `docs/` — governance, planning, and session docs
- `infra/` — docker-compose and infra config

### Services
| Service | Language | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `api-gateway-bff` | TypeScript / NestJS | External traffic entry point |
| `auth-service` | Go / Chi | Identity & JWT auth |
| `book-service` | Go / Chi | Books, chapters, chunks |
| `sharing-service` | Go / Chi | Visibility & sharing |
| `catalog-service` | Go / Chi | Public catalog |
| `provider-registry-service` | Go / Chi | BYOK AI provider credentials |
| `usage-billing-service` | Go / Chi | Usage metering & billing |
| `translation-service` | Go / Chi | Translation pipeline |
| `glossary-service` | Go / Chi | Glossary & lore management |
| `chat-service` | Python / FastAPI | Chat with LLMs via LiteLLM |
| `video-gen-service` | Python / FastAPI | Video generation (skeleton — provider TBD) |

Data: Postgres (per-service DBs), Redis Streams (jobs), MinIO (objects).

### Key Rules
- **Contract-first**: API contract frozen before frontend flow
- **Gateway invariant**: all external traffic through `api-gateway-bff`
- **Provider gateway invariant**: NO direct provider SDK calls — all AI calls go through adapter layer
- **Language rule**: Go for domain services, Python for AI/LLM services, TypeScript for gateway/BFF
- Each microservice owns its own Postgres database

## Session Protocol

### Session Start (every session)

1. **Read** `docs/sessions/SESSION_PATCH.md` — orient to current state, active work, blockers
2. **Check** the relevant planning doc in `docs/03_planning/` for whatever module you're working on
3. If ContextHub MCP is available, optionally call `search_lessons` and `search_code` for prior context

### Session End

Update `docs/sessions/SESSION_PATCH.md` with:
- What was completed
- What is next
- Any new open blockers

---

## MCP Integration (ContextHub)

ContextHub MCP server (`http://localhost:3000/mcp`) is an **optional tool** for persistent memory and semantic code search. Use it when available, skip when it's not running.

### When to use MCP tools

| Tool | When | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `search_code` | Before grepping for code | Semantic search finds by intent |
| `search_lessons` | Starting a task | Load prior decisions/preferences |
| `add_lesson` | After significant decisions | Persist knowledge for future sessions |
| `check_guardrails` | Before risky actions (push, deploy, migration) | Enforce captured team rules |
| `index_project` | After major code changes | Keep search results current |

### MCP is optional — not a blocker

If MCP server is down or unavailable:
- Use standard tools (Glob, Grep, Read) to find code
- Use `docs/sessions/SESSION_PATCH.md` for session continuity
- Use `docs/03_planning/` for module context
- Skip `check_guardrails` — use common sense instead

---

## Phase Checkpoint Protocol

Update `docs/sessions/SESSION_PATCH.md` at meaningful phase boundaries:

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| A module backend/frontend completes | Update Module Status Matrix |
| A new blocker is discovered | Add to Open Blockers |
| A blocker is resolved | Remove from Open Blockers |
| A commit batch closes a work item | Update Session History + Current Active Work |

**Rule:** if you complete more than one commit's worth of work, update SESSION_PATCH before moving to the next phase.

---

## Task Workflow (9 phases per task)

Every task follows this workflow. The agent plays all roles sequentially.

```
Phase     │ Role              │ What Happens
──────────┼───────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────
1. PLAN   │ Architect + PO    │ Define scope, acceptance criteria, deps
2. DESIGN │ Lead              │ API contract / component API / data flow
3. REVIEW │ PO + Lead         │ Review design before coding
4. BUILD  │ Developer         │ Write code (backend then frontend)
5. TEST   │ Developer         │ Run locally, fix bugs, write unit tests
6. REVIEW │ Lead              │ Code review (patterns, security, a11y)
7. QC     │ QA / PO           │ Test against acceptance criteria
8. SESSION│ Developer         │ Update SESSION_PATCH.md + task status
9. COMMIT │ Developer         │ Git commit + push
```

**Status tracking:** `[ ]` not started · `[P]` plan · `[D]` design · `[B]` build · `[R]` review · `[Q]` QC · `[S]` session · `[✓]` done

**Task types:** `[FE]` frontend only · `[BE]` backend only · `[FS]` full-stack (backend + frontend)

**Role perspectives:**
- **Architect** — scoping, dependencies, system-level impact
- **PO (Product Owner)** — acceptance criteria, design sign-off, final QC
- **Lead** — technical design, code review (patterns, security, a11y)
- **Developer** — implementation, testing, session tracking, commits
- **QA** — test against acceptance criteria, edge cases, regression

When playing each role, shift perspective accordingly. Architect thinks about system boundaries. PO thinks about user value and acceptance. Lead thinks about code quality and maintainability. Developer thinks about correctness and efficiency. QA thinks about what can break.

---

## Module Progression

Modules are implemented in order. Each module has a full doc set in `docs/03_planning/`:
- Execution pack, API contract, frontend flow spec, backend/frontend detailed design
- UI/UX wireframe spec, integration sequence diagrams, acceptance test plan
- Implementation readiness gate, governance review checklist

Read only the docs for the module you're actively working on.
